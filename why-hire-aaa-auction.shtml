	<h1>Why Hire AAA Auction</h1>

	<h2>Experience</h2>
		<p>AAA Auction has hosted hundreds of successful live and online auctions over the last 13 years.</p>

	<h2>Honest and Dedicated Staff</h2>
		<p>We know how important you are to our business and so we go the extra mile to exceed your expectations. We treat our customers the way we would want to be treated and we take pride in the testimonials we have received about our honesty and friendliness. We enjoy what we do and it shows.</p>
		 
	<h2>Credentials</h2>
		<p>We are professional in all we do. Tony, our owner, is a licensed auctioneer, real estate broker, federal firearms dealer, and attorney. Both he and his wife, Denise, are accredited appraisers of personal property.</p>

	<h2>Full Service</h2>
		<p>Whether you need an onsite live auction, an online auction, or a full or partial buy-out, we can help. Whether you need a six-hour auction or just have a few things to sell, we can do that. Whether you bring things to us or have us come and pick them up, we can do that too; and if you don’t know what to do, we will take the time to present some options for you and we will recommend what we think will best meet your needs.</p>

	<h2>Convenient</h2>
		<p>Our online consignment auctions are held at our auction barn in Nowthen and our live consignment auctions take place at Mau’s Corner just three miles north of St. Francis on Highway 47. We also do full onsite live auctions and we are happy to ship your items to you as well.</p>
