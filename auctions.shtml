auctions can be conducted at our Auction Center in Anoka or at your
location. If you need help moving your items to the Auction Center, we
can help you with that. If we come to your location, we bring
everything necessary to hold a good old-fashioned auction. We can also
do all of the set-up or show you how to do it. If you don't have enough
items for your own auction, we can add your items to other items we
have for a consignment auction.<br>&nbsp;<br>At this time we hold live
traditional auctions and live consignment auctions when we have enough
items for a good auction, so we suggest that you click on the e-mail
notification link so we will be able to let you know when we are
holding an auction. <br>&nbsp;<br>Our experienced auctioneers are fully licensed to legally sell your cars, guns, and real estate.<br></font></big><div id="Footer">
