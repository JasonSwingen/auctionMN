<p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Q:
What types of auctions does AAA Auction
and Realty do?</b>
<br>
<b>A:</b>
AAA Auction and Realty is a
full-service auction
company. Our experienced auctioneers are fully licensed to legally sell
your cars, guns, and real estate. In addition to doing online
consignment auctions and traditional on-site live auctions, our
owner,&nbsp;Tony Elfelt, is a certified benefit auction specialist
who
is
often asked to conduct&nbsp;live benefit auctions. AAA Auction and
Realty is also
a real estate brokerage, and we represent buyers and sellers in real
estate transactions&nbsp;using</font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> either</font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> the auction method, or
traditional
real estate sales techniques.<br>
<br>
<b><big>Auctions</big></b>&nbsp;<br>
<b><br>
Q:
Where do your auctions take place? </b><br>
<b>A:</b> If
your facility or residence is large enough to conduct a live auction,
we
will conduct it at your location. If you would rather not have the
auction at your location or if your property is not large enough to
support an auction, we will conduct the auction at the Anoka Auction
and Estate Center (AAEC) at 530 West Main Street in Anoka, or at
another facility.
Common facilities to use for auctions are county fairgrounds, VFW's,
American Legions and other halls.&nbsp;</font></big></p>
<p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">If
you need help moving your items to
the Auction Center, we
can help you with that. If we come to your location, we bring
everything necessary to hold a good old-fashioned auction. We can also
do all of the set-up or show you how to do it. If you don't have enough
items for your own auction, we can add your items to other items we
have for a consignment auction.</font></big></p>
<p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Items
for online auctions are
typically stored at and picked up from the AAEC.&nbsp;</font></big></p>
<p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Q:
How does that work if I want to bring something to Mau's Corner to sell?<br>
A:</b></font></big> &nbsp;<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><big>Please see
our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.auctionmn.com/mauscorner.shtml">Mau's
Corner&nbsp;Information Page</a>.<br>
</big></font></p>
<p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Q:
What is a reserve auction? </b><br>
<b>A:</b>
A reserve auction is an
auction where the seller has
the final choice to either accept or reject the highest bid. Common
places to find reserves are at auctions of real estate or of other
valuable items.</font>
</big></p>
<p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Q:
What is an absolute auction?</b>
<br>
<b>A:</b> In an absolute auction, an item sells for the
highest bid regardless of the amount.
</font></big></p>
<p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>For
Buyers</b></font></big></big></p>
<p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Q:
What is an absentee bid and do you
accept them?</b>
<br>
<b>A:</b>
An absentee bid is a bid
placed on an item before the
auction starts. The bid is usually guaranteed with a credit card. The
auctioneer will then bid for you as much as is necessary, up to your
maximum bid, for you to win the item. For example, if your maximum bid
is $100 and the bidding is progressing in $10 increments, and if the
last bid was $50, the auctioneer will put you in for $60. If no one
else bids, you will win the item for $60. There is usually a $5 fee if
you are the winning bidder with an absentee bid.</font>
</big></p>
<p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Q:
What is a Buyer's Premium?</b>
<br>
<b>A:</b> A Buyer's Premium is an additional charge paid by
the purchaser of an item. It is often around 13% of the winning bid.
For example, if a buyer purchases an item for $100.00, the total charge
to the buyer would be $113.00. This amount, together with whatever the
seller is being charged, makes up the auctioneer's commission.
</font></big></p>
<p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Q:
How do I pay for my items?</b>
<br>
<b>A:</b> AAA Auction accepts cash, in-state checks, Visa
and Mastercard.
</font></big></p>
<p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Q:
Do I have to pay sales tax?</b>
<br>
<b>A:</b> Usually there is no sales tax charged at an
auction where all of the&nbsp;items are from one seller, but there
are some exceptions. For example, when we sell
inventory owned by a business, buyers must pay the same sales tax that
they would have paid at that business. Sales tax is charged at
consignment auctions when the items are from more than one person. The
buyer's premium is also taxable.
</font></big></p>
<big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Q:
What
if I have only a few things that I would
like to sell?</b>
<br>
</font></big>
<p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>A:</b>
If you have only a few things
to sell, you are welcome to consign them to us for sale at one of our
auctions. It is very common to combine items from more than one seller
in order to have a good amount of items to sell. AAA Auction reserves
the right to refuse any items that have no value or that are
inconsistent with the other items being sold.
</font></big></p>
<p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>For
Sellers</b></font></big></big></p>
<p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Q:
Why should I sell at auction?</b>
<br>
<b>A:</b>
Auctions are the best way to
sell items for their true
market value. The excitement of the auction experience often helps
bring even higher prices for the items sold. Auctions are also
predictable because the seller can determine the day his merchandise
will sell as opposed to placing an ad in the paper and hoping the
telephone rings. Also, all sales are "As Is," so returns are not a
problem.
</font></big></p>
<p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Q:
How much would it cost me to have you
do an auction for me?</b>
<br>
<b>A:</b> We determine the
commission for a full estate auction or a
business liquidation on a case-by-case basis. The commission
depends on
the amount of work involved and the approximate value of the auction.
We are also able to charge a reduced rate for an estate auction if we
are asked to sell the real estate too. So, if we are doing an auction
that brings in a lot of money, our rates are very low. On the other
hand, if the auction has a low value, we will need to charge a higher
rate. <br>
<b><br>
Q: </b><b>I don't have enough items for a full auction. </b><b>What
do you charge to sell something on consignment?&nbsp;</b><br>
<b>A:</b> </font></big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><big>The commission rate for guns is 0%. You get the full amount of whatever the gun sells for. The
commission
rate for coins&nbsp;is 12%. Our&nbsp;commission rates on other items are
shown in the&nbsp;table below. </big></font><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Different
commissions are determined for entire estates.</font></big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><big><br>

</font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Q:
How soon do I get paid after the
auction?</b>
</font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><br>
A:</b>
We will have a check for you within seven days of
the auction.
</font></big>
<p dir="ltr"><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Q:
What do I have to do
to get ready for the auction?</b>
<br>
<b>A:</b> Most of our clients set up their items for their
auctions themselves. We will show you how to group your items and how
to display them. Most people have friends and family help with this job
because it can be a lot of work. If you are unable to set up your items
for the auction, we will hire people to do that for you and bill you
for that service.
</font></big></p>
<big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Q:
What
happens to the items that don't sell?</b>
<br>
</font></big>
<p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>A:</b>
Usually everything sells at
an auction. For example, if
something does not get a bid by itself, we simply add other items to it
until a bid is made. However, if there are things left over after an
auction that the purchaser fails to remove from the property, it is the
seller's responsibility to remove them. Once again, AAA Auction can
provide help for that if our seller cannot do it himself or herself.
</font></big></p>
<p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Q:
Who does the advertising?</b>
<br>
<b>A:</b> AAA Auction does all of the advertising for the
auction. This will include newspapers and various internet web sites.
It also may include direct mail. Although the auctioneer initially pays
for the advertising, the seller reimburses the auctioneer for all of
those expenses out of the sale proceeds. These expenses are discussed
with our clients when the auction contract is signed.
