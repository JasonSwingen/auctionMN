			<h1>General Terms and Conditions</h1>

			<hr>
			<p><i>The following are a set of our General Terms and Conditions, however each auctions terms may be slightly different, so it is important before bidding in an auction that you read and understand the terms that apply to that auction.

			<!-- <h2>PREVIEW, PICK-UP AND COVID 19 TERMS</h2>
			<p>CHANGES FOR BIDDERS</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Preview will be on Saturday, September 5 from 2-5 pm.  Previewers may either  go online at www.signupgenius.com or go to the AAA Auction and Realty, LLC Facebook page and click a link to signupgenius to schedule their 20-minute preview time slot. To maintain social distancing, we ask Previewers to limit their time on the premises to no more than 20 minutes.</li>
				<li>No person should attend preview or pick-up if he or she feels sick or has been exposed to a possible case of the Corona Virus within the two weeks preceding the pick-up. For those cases, the buyer should arrange with us to have someone else pick up his or her purchase.</li>
				<li>Since this location is not our regular place of business,  if you miss pick-up, you will not be able to reschedule another pick-up date.</li>
				<li>Masks must be worn and social distancing must be followed  as much as possible.    </li>
				<li>Successful buyers must also schedule their pick-up time slot with SingupGenius as described above. </li>
				<li>AAA Auction will not provide any carrying or loading assistance.</li>
				<li>Buyers must remove and load their items from the house or detached garage themselves. Small lots will be placed in a convenient location, but the larger or heavier lots will be inside the home or detached garage. Some items, such as the pool table in the home, will need to be carried up a stairway or out a walk-out basement door and through the yard.   </li>
				<li>To the best of our knowledge, neither the Sellers nor anyone on the AAA staff have been exposed to anyone who has the virus.</li>
			</ol>

			<i>The following are a set of our General Terms and Conditions, however each auctions terms may be slightly different, so it is important before bidding in an auction that you read and understand the terms that apply to that auction. If there is
				any inconsistency between these general terms and the terms above, the terms above shall apply.</i>

			<hr> -->



			<h2>As-Is And Other Limitations</h2>

			<p>All items are sold "AS IS," "WHERE IS," and "FINAL," with no warranties, express or implied.</p>

			<p>Illustrations, pictures, sounds, or videos posted on AAA Auction's website are for identification purposes only and are not warranties of any type. Photos are merely representative of the items and may not be relied upon for disclosure of all
				defects. All measurements are approximate and AAA Auction encourages bidders to preview our auctions and measure items themselves. AAA Auction does not grade items or guarantee the authenticity of any item, including autographs. Grading and many
				specific descriptions are provided by the sellers and are assumed to be true; however, AAA Auction does not know whether the descriptions and grading provided by sellers are correct. AAA does not guarantee the accuracy of any outside appraisals.
				AAA does not guarantee representations from sellers such as a jersey being "game worn". AAA makes an effort to be correct when listing the dates and mint marks of coins; however, due to the difficulty in reading some dates and mint marks, AAA
				does not guarantee the correctness of any dates or mint marks and encourages bidders to
				inspect the coins themselves. AAA Auction does not know whether some items are reproductions or originals. The buyer assumes complete and sole responsibility for inspection of items before bidding and relies solely on his or her inspection as to
				the condition, authenticity, and value of items. Occasionally, we include estimated values in the descriptions of items. These are usually based upon similar sales as found on eBay, Worthpoint and the like. Any such statements are statements of
				our opinion only and are not guaranteed. Buyers are advised to do their research before bidding on any item. The buyer waives any claims against AAA Auction and seller based upon the condition or value of items.</p>
			<h2>Electronics</h2>

			<p>AAA Auction does not assemble electronics for testing. Our testing goes no further than to plug in an item to see if it powers up. Also, when referring to old radios, we may say the radio “works”. That merely means that the radio powered up
				and at least one station came in. It does not mean that the sound was perfect or that all features of the radio worked properly. In addition, unless easily accomplished, AAA Auction does not remove speaker covers for photographs. Therefore
				inspection of electronics if highly recommended.</p>


			<h2>Bidding Terms</h2>

			<p>Bidders must be at least 18 years old. Buyers of handguns and handgun ammunition must be 21 years old.</p>

			<p>The bidding process described in the link: <a href="/online_bidding_information.shtml">How to Bid Online</a> is incorporated into these terms by reference.</p>

			<h2>Special Terms for Each Auction</h2>

			<p>Each auction may have Special Terms for that auction that may differ slightly from these General Terms. If that occurs, The Special Terms for each auction shall apply. Bidder agrees that any details provided in the Auctioneer’s Note or home page for any auction shall be part of the contractual terms for the auction and are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>

			<h2>Previews</h2>

			<p>Please see the special terms for each auction for information about Previews.</p>

			<h2>Covid 19</h2>

			<p>To maintain the safest environment possible for our customers, AAA Auction asks our bidders to follow the following:</p>
 			<p>If you have been exposed to a possible case of the Corona Virus within the two weeks preceding the pick-up day, please arrange with us to have someone else pick up your purchase.
			<p>Masks must be worn and social distancing must be followed as much as possible.</p>
			<p>Successful buyers must also schedule their pick-up time slot with SingupGenius as described above.</p>

			<h2>Loading</h2>

			<p>	Buyers must load their items. If the pick-up is at the Auction Barn, AAA staff will bring most items out of the building for you. If the pick-up is at a private home, it may be necessary for you to enter the home or a detached building to remove your items. This may involve carrying items up from a basement or down from an upper level. Please check the special terms for each auction to see if this applies and call AAA Auction if you have any concerns.</p>

			<h2>Type Of Payment</h2>

			<p>We accept cash, good checks, cashier's checks, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. Two forms of ID are needed for checks, with at least one being a photo ID. No out-of-state checks.
				AAA Auction reserves the
				right to postpone shipping any item until the Buyer's check clears the bank. There is a $30.00 fee on all returned checks. Credit cards will be accepted up to $5,000. Unless prior arrangements are made, coins must be paid for with cash, and
				titled items must be paid for with cash. Checks in an amount over $5,000 must be guaranteed with a valid credit card and not a check card.</p>

			<p>Also, payment to AAA Auction in cash of $10,000 or more requires the buyer to complete the IRS form 8300.</p>

			<p><b>Guns and Coins:</b> Unless prior arrangements have been made with the auctioneer, we will accept cash and debit cards only.</p>

			<p>AAA Auction reserves the right to ask for and obtain credit card information from any bidder to guarantee any check written for $500 or more. Common reasons are out-of-the-area bidders and bids over $100. Failure to provide credit card
				information when requested to do so may result in the cancellation of your bid. Winning bidders may still pick up their items at the regular pick-up time and use cash or a good check to purchase their items.</p>

			<h2>Buyer's Premium</h2>

			<p>Please check each individual auction for it's buyer's premium.</p>
			<!-- <p>There is a 10% buyer's premium on all auction purchases plus a 3% service fee if paying with a credit card.</p> -->

			<h2>Sales Tax</h2>

			<!-- <p>Unless we announce that there is no sales tax on a specific auction or the buyer provides us with a tax-exempt form, Minnesota sales tax will be charged on all purchases. Sales tax is computed on the combined amount of the winning bid and
				Buyer's Premium.</p> -->
			<p>Unless the auction is an estate auction for one person only, as opposed to a consignment auction, sales tax will be charged. Please check the involved auction to see if sales tax will be collected.</p>


			<h2>Sale Items Subject To Change</h2>

			<p>The auctioneer reserves the right to add items to or remove items from the auction at any time, even during the bidding process; to split or combine lots; to edit descriptions; to add or remove photos; to add minimum bids or reserve prices; to
				cancel, suspend, extend or reschedule an individual item and or an entire auction; or to change any auction's closing time, preview time, or pick-up time.</p>

			<h2>Missed Pick-Ups</h2>

			<p>You agree to pick up your items at the regularly scheduled pick-up time for the involved auction. If you know that you cannot attend the regularly scheduled pick-up time at the Auction Barn, you will be able to call AAA Auction and pay for your item with a credit card on the pick-up day. We will then be able to hold your item for you for a later pick-up that must occur on or before the next auction’s pick-up day. There is no extra charge for this. We will not be able to offer that service for auctions that take place away from the Auction Barn.</p>
			<p>If you miss pick-up and do not call us and pay for your item on the pick-up day, it shall be within the discretion of AAA Auction to cancel your bids as well as your future privileges.</p>
			<p>Please see the special terms for each auction to see if there are any changes offered for that auction.</p>

			<h2>Guns and Ammo</h2>
			<p>All federal, state and local laws apply to the sale and transfer of guns at this auction and the Buyers are responsible for knowing all federal, state and local laws of the location where the gun will be transferred. In Minnesota, Buyers of handguns must have a carry or a purchase permit or an FFL license to take possession of a handgun.</p>

			<p>Bidders may win a bid and pay for a handgun without the necessary permit; however, if that occurs AAA Auction shall retain possession of the handgun for up to 2 months while the Buyer obtains the necessary permit. Once the Buyer obtains the required permit the Buyer shall fill out a 4473 at the AAA Auction location. The sale shall be deemed complete only after a successful background check at which time the gun shall be transferred to the Buyer. If more than two months go by without the Buyer providing the necessary permit to AAA Auction and passing the background check, then AAA Auction may cancel the sale and refund the purchase price to the Buyer less the amount of the Buyer’s Premium charged which AAA Auction shall keep as liquidated damages.</p>

The Buyer assumes all responsibility for the legality of the firearm when he or she purchases it. The Buyer must be the actual buyer of the gun and not be buying it for another person. Buyers of rifles and shotguns must be 18 years old. Buyers of handguns and guns with pistol grips (AR type rifles) must at least 21 years old.</p>

AAA Auction and Buyer’s use of the ammunition is at his or her own risk. Buyer shall hold AAA Auction harmless and shall indemnify AAA Auction and its staff from any and all claims for damages, loss, injury or the like arising from the sale and use of said ammunition.</p>

			<h2>Shipping</h2>
			<p>AAA Auction will generally ship items sold at the AAA Auction barn through the USPO. We will not ship items sold at an offsite location or large items or items that are difficult to package. There is a handling charge of $9.00 per box as well as the actual fees charged by the post office. Please see the special terms for each auction to see if there are any changes for that auction.</p>

			<h2>Hold Harmless</h2>

			<p>Bidder does hereby indemnify and hold harmless the Auctioneer and the Seller from any damages, claims, or liabilities from injuries to persons or property of any type whatsoever, caused before, during, or after the auction.</p>

			<h2>With Reserve</h2>

			<p>All auctions and auction items by law in Minnesota are with reserve unless stated as absolute. This means that the Seller may bid on his items and the Auctioneer and his staff reserve the right to bid on and purchase items in this auction as
				well.</p>

			<h2>Internet Service</h2>

			<p>We do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted access to our services. The operation of the website and services may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. AAA Auction is not responsible for lost or misdirected e-mails, slowness in the transmission of bids, technical difficulties that result in loss of Bidder's internet connection with www.auctionmn.com, or other technical problems. AAA Auction is not responsible for any difficulties that may occur in the proper or timely transmission or access of e-mail forwarded to any e-mail address. The vagaries of the Internet, spam filters, lack of storage space, and rules set by different Internet service providers are all additional factors which may fail to deliver e-mails as expected.</p>

				<h2>Terms May Change</h2>

				<p>All terms and conditions are subject to change.</p>

			<!-- <h2>Shipping</h2>

			<p>We will be happy to ship most items if asked to do so. We will not ship more than 20 pounds per box; however, if you ask us first, we may be able to take a heavy item to a shipper and have them box the item and ship it for you. If that is what you would like us to do, then you must pay the shipper yourself as well as our handling fee which is $20 per item for those we take to a shipper. If you would like an item shipped, you must call us at (763) 421-3044 or e-mail us at info@auctionmn.com before or during the regularly scheduled pick-up time and provide us with your
				shipping instructions and credit card information to pay for the items. Your credit card will then be charged the amount stated on your invoice. Your credit card will be charged again later when the shipping costs have been determined. The
				shipping cost shall be the fees charged by the shipper such as the post office plus insurance plus reasonable handling charges which shall be $9.00 for envelopes and USPS boxes. The handling fee shall be more than $9.00 for non-USPS boxes.
				Shipping costs for non-USPS boxes shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. AAA Auction shall place insurance on the package in an amount as close as possible to the invoice total of the item. Any claim against AAA Auction and Realty, LLC
				shall be limited to the insurance placed upon the package during shipping.</p>

			<p>We reserve the right to not ship an item for any reason such as the size or fragile nature of the item. So, if you are bidding on something that would be difficult to ship, please call us before the auction closes to find out if we can ship
				the item or not. If we cannot ship the item, you will need to arrange another shipping method. Large items cost a lot to ship, so please consider that when bidding. If the successful bidder decides not to pay the shipping costs or pick up the
				item won, he or she is still required to pay the full amount stated on the invoice. We will then resell the item at the same commission on behalf of the winning bidder at a subsequent auction.</p>

				“Delay”, the gun will be kept by AAA Auction until we receive the final decision from the FBI; however, if three business days pass since the original “Delay” response, and if no subsequent “Denied” response has been received by AAA Auction, AAA
				Auction shall then transfer the gun to the Buyer. If the response from the FBI to the background check is ‘Deny”, the Buyer shall not be entitled to a refund. Rather, AAA Auction shall retain possession of the gun and shall sell it at the next

				for the gun and AAA Auction shall retain possession of the gun for up to one month. At any time during the month the Buyer produces a qualifying permit or license, AAA Auction shall transfer the gun to the Buyer subject to an FBI background
				check. If a month goes by and the Buyer has not produced a qualifying permit or license, then AAA Auction and shall sell the gun at the next available auction for the Buyer (now Seller) at the regular rates being charged at that time.</p>

			<p><strong>Out of State Buyers.</strong> AAA will sell guns to out of state buyers; however, the guns must be shipped to a licensed dealer where the transfer will take place and where a background check will be done. The AAA Buyer must provide
				AAA Auction with the name, phone number, and address of the dealer to whom the gun will be shipped. The AAA Buyer must also have the receiving dealer email a copy of his or her FFL license to tony@auctionmn.com. The email should also contain the
				name of the AAA Auction customer. There likely will be a fee charged to the AAA buyer by the receiving dealer. Shipping and handling fees shall apply. Black Power and Guns Made Before 1898. No background checks are required for black powder guns
				and guns made in or before 1898.</p>

			<p><strong>Buyer.</strong> The Buyer at AAA Auction must be the actual Buyer of the gun. Guns will not be sold to a person buying the gun for another person.</p>

			<p><strong>Background Checks on Sellers.</strong> If any gun must be returned to a Seller (such as the gun not selling due to not meeting a reserve) AAA Auction is required to run a background check on the Seller. The procedure for a background
