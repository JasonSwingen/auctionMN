<i>The following are a set of our General Terms and Conditions, however each auctions terms may be slightly different, so it is important before bidding in an auction that you read and understand the terms that apply to that auction.</i>
<h1>General Terms and Conditions</h1>
	<h2>As-is And Other Limitations</h2>
		<p>All items are sold "AS IS," "WHERE IS," and "FINAL," with no warranties, express or implied.</p>

All measurements are approximate and AAA Auction encourages bidde"AS IS," "WHrs to preview our auctions and measure items themselves. AAA Auction does not guarantee the authenticity of any item, including autographs. Many specific descriptions are provided by the sellers and are assumed to be true; however, AAA Auction does not know whether the descriptions provided by sellers are correct. AAA Auction does not know whether some items are reproductions or originals. Buyer assumes complete and sole responsibility for inspection of items prior to bidding and relies solely on his or her own inspection as to the condition, authenticity, and value of items. Buyer waives any and all claims against AAA Auction and seller based on the condition or value of items.</p> 
	<h2>Bidding Terms</h2>

		<p>AAA Auction requires a valid credit card in order to guarantee all online bids.</p> 
	<h2>Type Of Payment</h2>
		<p>We accept cash, good checks, cashier's checks, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. Two forms of ID are needed for checks, with at least one being a photo ID. No out-of-state checks. AAA Auction reserves the right to postpone shipping any item until the Buyer's check clears the bank. There is a $30.00 fee on all returned checks. Credit cards will be accepted up to $5,000. Unless prior arrangements are made, coins must be paid for with cash, and titled items must be paid for with cash. Checks in an amount over $5,000 must be guaranteed with a valid credit card and not a check card.</p>

	<h2>Sale Items Subject To Change</h2>
		<p>The auctioneer reserves the right to add items to or remove items from the auction; to split or combine lots; to edit descriptions; to add or remove photos; to add minimum bids or reserve prices; to cancel, suspend, extend or reschedule an individual item and or an entire auction; or to change an auction's closing time, preview time, or pick-up time.</p> 
	<h2>Shipping</h2>
		<p>We will assume that all Buyers will pick up their purchases at the regularly scheduled time unless we are otherwise notified. It is essential that you pick up your items at the scheduled time or arrange with us to have them shipped to you. If you do not pick your items up at the regularly scheduled time, we will charge you a handling and late pick-up fee based upon the amount and size of the items we move and store for you. For small and easily moved items the fee shall be $10.00. The fee for large items shall be determined on a case by case basis. If you do not make arrangements with us and if we still have your items after three days, you will lose those items and your privilege of bidding at any of our future auctions. We will be happy to ship items if asked to do so, provided they are not too large. We will then charge actual shipping costs plus insurance plus $9.00 handling for most boxes. Shipping costs for large items will be determined on a case by case basis. We will combine small items into one box if possible. We will let the Buyer know if the item is too large for us to ship in which case the Buyer will need to arrange his or her own shipping. Guns can only be shipped to an FFL dealer.</p>
