<i>The following are a set of our General Terms and Conditions, however each auctions terms may be slightly different, so it is important before bidding in an auction that you read and understand the terms that apply to that auction.</i>

<hr>

<h1>General Terms and Conditions</h1>

	<h2>As-Is And Other Limitations</h2>

		<p>All items are sold "AS IS," "WHERE IS," and "FINAL," with no warranties, express or implied.</p>

		<p>Illustrations, pictures, sounds, or videos posted on AAA Auction's website are for identification purposes only and are not warranties of any type. Photos are merely representative of the items and may not be relied upon for disclosure of all defects. All measurements are approximate and AAA Auction encourages bidders to preview our auctions and measure items themselves. AAA Auction does not guarantee the authenticity of any item, including autographs. Many specific descriptions are provided by the sellers and are assumed to be true; however, AAA Auction does not know whether the descriptions provided by sellers are correct. AAA Auction does not know whether some items are reproductions or originals. Buyer assumes complete and sole responsibility for inspection of items prior to bidding and relies solely on his or her own inspection as to the condition, authenticity, and value of items. Buyer waives any and all claims against AAA Auction and seller based upon the condition or value of items.</p>

	<h2>Bidding Terms</h2>

		<p>Bidders must be at least 18 years old.</p>

		<p>The bidding process described in the link: <a href="/online_bidding_information.shtml">How to Bid Online</a> is incorporated to these terms by reference.</p>

	<h2>Type Of Payment</h2>

		<p>We accept cash, good checks, cashier's checks, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. Two forms of ID are needed for checks, with at least one being a photo ID. No out-of-state checks. AAA Auction reserves the right to postpone shipping any item until the Buyer's check clears the bank. There is a $30.00 fee on all returned checks. Credit cards will be accepted up to $5,000. Unless prior arrangements are made, coins must be paid for with cash, and titled items must be paid for with cash. Checks in an amount over $5,000 must be guaranteed with a valid credit card and not a check card.</p>

		<p>AAA Auction reserves the right to ask for and obtain credit card information from any bidder at any time for any reason. Common reasons are out-of-the-area bidders and bids in excess of $100. Failure to provide credit card information when requested to do so may result in the cancellation of your bid.Winning bidders may still pick up their items at the regular pick-up time and use cash or a good check to purchase their items.</p>

	<h2>Buyer's Premium</h2>

		<p>There is a 15% buyer's premium on all auction purchases plus a 3% service fee if paying with a credit card.</p>

	<h2>Sale Items Subject To Change</h2>

		<p>The auctioneer reserves the right to add items to or remove items from the auction at any time, even during the bidding process; to split or combine lots; to edit descriptions; to add or remove photos; to add minimum bids or reserve prices; to cancel, suspend, extend or reschedule an individual item and or an entire auction; or to change an auction's closing time, preview time, or pick-up time.</p>

	<h2>Late Pick-up Fee $10.00</h2>

		<p>We will assume that all you will pick up your purchases at the regularly scheduled time unless we are otherwise notified. It is essential that you pick up your items at the scheduled time or arrange with us to have them shipped to you. If you do not pick your items up at the regularly scheduled time, we will charge you a handling and late pick-up fee based upon the amount and size of the items we move and store for you. For small and easily moved items the fee shall be $10.00. The fee for large items shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. If you have made no arrangements with us we still have your items after two days, you will lose those items and you will not be allowed to bid at any of our future auctions. If you make arrangements with us for a later pick-up, we will need to bill your credit card for the items and for the late pick-up fees. We will only hold your paid items for one week. After one week you authorize us to re-sell the items at our regular rates on your behalf.</p>

	<h2>Shipping</h2>

		<p>We will be happy to ship most items if asked to do so. If you would like an item shipped, you must call us at (763) 421-3044 or e-mail us at info@auctionmn.com before or during the regular scheduled pick-up time and provide us with your shipping instructions and credit card information to pay for the items. Your credit card will then be charged the amount stated on your invoice. Your credit card will be charged again later when the shipping costs have been determined. The shipping cost shall be the fees charged by the shipper such as the post office plus insurance plus reasonable handling charges which shall be $9.00 for envelopes and USPS boxes. The handling fee shall be more than $9.00 for non-USPS boxes. Shipping costs for non-USPS boxes shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. AAA Auction shall place insurance on the package in an amount as close as possible to the invoice total of the item. Any claim against AAA Auction and Realty, LLC shall be limited to the insurance placed upon the package during shipping. </p>

		<p>We reserve the right to not ship an item for any reason such as the size or fragile nature of the item. So, if you are bidding on something that would be difficult to ship, please call us before the auction closes to find out if we can ship the item or not. If we cannot ship the item, you will need to arrange another shipping method. Large items cost a lot to ship, so please take that into consideration when bidding. If the successful bidder decides not to pay the shipping costs or pick up the item won, he or she is still required to pay the full amount stated on the invoice. We will then resell the item at the same commission on behalf of the winning bidder at a subsequent auction.</p>

	<h2>Misc. Terms</h2>

		<p>Any alcohol contained in a collectible bottle is not sold for consumption and will not be sold to anyone under 21 years of age.</p>

		<p>AAA Auction disclaims any knowledge of the history of any ammunition sold. AAA Auction does not know how old the ammo is or whether the ammo has been reloaded. Use at your own risk. AAA Auction disclaims any liability arising out of the use of said ammunition.</p>

	<h2>Hold Harmless</h2>

		<p>Bidder does hereby indemnify and hold harmless the Auctioneer and the Seller from any and all damages, claims, or liabilities from injuries to persons or property of any type whatsoever, caused before, during, or after the auction.</p>

	<h2>With Reserve</h2>

		<p>All auctions and auction items by law in Minnesota are with reserve unless stated as absolute. This means that the Seller may bid on his own items and the Auctioneer and his staff reserve the right to bid on and purchase items in this auction as well.</p>

	<h2>Internet Service</h2>

		<p>We do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted access to our services. Operation of the website and services may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. AAA Auction is not responsible for lost or misdirected e-mails, slowness in transmission of bids, technical difficulties that result in loss of Bidder's internet connection with www.auctionmn.com, or other technical problems. AAA Auction is not responsible for any difficulties that may occur in the proper or timely transmission or access of e-mail forwarded to any e-mail address. The vagaries of the Internet, spam filters, lack of storage space, and rules set by different Internet service providers are all additional factors which may result in failure to deliver e-mails as expected.</p>

	<h2>Terms May Change</h2>

		<p>All terms and conditions are subject to change.</p>
