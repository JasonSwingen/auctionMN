			<h1>General Terms and Conditions</h1>
			<h2>NEW COVID 19 TERMS</h2>
			<p>CHANGES FOR BIDDERS</p>

			<ol>
				<li>There will be no preview for items expecting to sell for $300 or less. Buyers may however void a sale if we fail to photograph or describe a significant defect in the item. For higher value items previews must be scheduled by
					calling AAA
					Auction at (763) 421-3044.</li>
				<li>No buyer should attend pick-up if they feel ill or have been exposed to a possible case of the Corona Virus within the two weeks preceding the pick-up. For those cases, the buyer should have someone else pick up his or her purchase. AAA
					Auction will try to accommodate failed pick-ups due to the virus; however, if we transport and store a purchased item, additional fees may be charged.</li>
				<li><b>NO CASH WILL BE USED.</b></li>
				<li>All purchases must be paid for with a good Minnesota check or with a credit or debit card. Also, to help our customers, AAA Auction will not charge the 3% credit card fee for the time being.</li>
				<li>To maintain social distancing, we ask that all buyers follow this system: Park on the street next to the driveway leading to the detached garage. We will have placed all of the small and light items in the detached garage. We will have a
					clerk in this area to accept your payment. (Please remember, no cash will be accepted.) We will then direct you to pull forward and park again and wait in your car until we bring your items to a table next to the street. After we have placed
					your items on the table, then please get out of your car and load them into your vehicle.</li>
				<li>If you have also purchased a large or heavy item that has been left in the house, then please drive into the driveway leading to the house. We will also have a clerk at the house to direct you to the location of your item. You will then need
					to carry your item out of the house and load it. Please bring enough help to carry and load your items yourself because <b>AAA AUCTION WILL NOT OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE CARRYING OR LOADING YOUR ITEM</b>.</li>
				<li>Except for the payment process, please maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from any other person during pick-up. Please remain in your vehicle unless loading your items.</li>
				<li>To the best of our knowledge, neither the Sellers nor anyone on the AAA staff have been exposed to anyone who has the virus.</li>
				<!-- <li>No shipping is offered for this auction.</li> -->
				<!-- <li>There is no sales tax for this auction.</li> -->
				<!-- <li>AAA staff will disinfect each table used for pick-ups after each buyer picks up his items.</li>

				<li>Except for the payment process, please maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from any other person during pick-up. Please do not park next to another car.</li>
				<li>For firearm purchases and after the buyer pays for the item, our clerk will provide the buyer with the required 4473 form which the buyer shall fill out while remaining in his car. When the buyer has completed the form, he should
					honk his
					horn or call out to a staff member who will retrieve the form and then direct the buyer where to park. The buyer then may begin loading any other purchase he has made, or shall wait in his car for the firearm to be brought out to him.</li> -->

			<hr>

			<i>The following are a set of our General Terms and Conditions, however each auctions terms may be slightly different, so it is important before bidding in an auction that you read and understand the terms that apply to that auction. If there is
				any inconsistency between these general terms and the terms above, the terms above shall apply.</i>

			<hr>



			<h2>As-Is And Other Limitations</h2>

			<p>All items are sold "AS IS," "WHERE IS," and "FINAL," with no warranties, express or implied.</p>

			<p>Illustrations, pictures, sounds, or videos posted on AAA Auction's website are for identification purposes only and are not warranties of any type. Photos are merely representative of the items and may not be relied upon for disclosure of all
				defects. All measurements are approximate and AAA Auction encourages bidders to preview our auctions and measure items themselves. AAA Auction does not grade items or guarantee the authenticity of any item, including autographs. Grading and many
				specific descriptions are provided by the sellers and are assumed to be true; however, AAA Auction does not know whether the descriptions and grading provided by sellers are correct. AAA does not guarantee the accuracy of any outside appraisals.
				AAA makes an effort to be correct when listing the dates and mint marks of coins; however, due to the difficulty in reading some dates and mint marks, AAA does not guarantee the correctness of any dates or mint marks and encourages bidders to
				inspect the coins themselves. AAA Auction does not know whether some items are reproductions or originals. The buyer assumes complete and sole responsibility for inspection of items before bidding and relies solely on his or her inspection as to
				the condition, authenticity, and value of items. Occasionally, we include estimated values in the descriptions of items. These are usually based upon similar sales as found on eBay, Worthpoint and the like. Any such statements are statements of
				our opinion only and are not guaranteed. Buyers are advised to do their research before bidding on any item. The buyer waives any claims against AAA Auction and seller based upon the condition or value of items.</p>
			<h2>Electronics</h2>

			<p>AAA Auction does not assemble electronics for testing. Our testing goes no further than to plug in an item to see if it powers up. Also, when referring to old radios, we may say the radio “works”. That merely means that the radio powered up
				and at least one station came in. It does not mean that the sound was perfect or that all features of the radio worked properly. In addition, unless easily accomplished, AAA Auction does not remove speaker covers for photographs. Therefore
				inspection of electronics if highly recommended.</p>


			<h2>Bidding Terms</h2>

			<p>Bidders must be at least 18 years old. Buyers of handguns and handgun ammunition must be 21 years old.</p>

			<p>The bidding process described in the link: <a href="/online_bidding_information.shtml">How to Bid Online</a> is incorporated into these terms by reference.</p>

			<h2>Type Of Payment</h2>

			<p>We accept cash (no coins, we will round down in your favor.) good checks, cashier's checks, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. Two forms of ID are needed for checks, with at least one being a photo ID. No out-of-state checks.
				AAA Auction reserves the
				right to postpone shipping any item until the Buyer's check clears the bank. There is a $30.00 fee on all returned checks. Credit cards will be accepted up to $5,000. Unless prior arrangements are made, coins must be paid for with cash, and
				titled items must be paid for with cash. Checks in an amount over $5,000 must be guaranteed with a valid credit card and not a check card.</p>

			<p>Also, payment to AAA Auction in cash of $10,000 or more requires the buyer to complete the IRS form 8300.</p>

			<p><b>Guns and Coins:</b> Unless prior arrangements have been made with the auctioneer, we will accept cash and debit cards only.</p>

			<p>AAA Auction reserves the right to ask for and obtain credit card information from any bidder to guarantee any check written for $500 or more. Common reasons are out-of-the-area bidders and bids over $100. Failure to provide credit card
				information when requested to do so may result in the cancellation of your bid. Winning bidders may still pick up their items at the regular pick-up time and use cash or a good check to purchase their items.</p>

			<h2>Buyer's Premium</h2>

			<p>There is a 15% buyer's premium on all auction purchases plus a 3% service fee if paying with a credit card.</p>

			<h2>Sales Tax</h2>

			<p>Unless we announce that there is no sales tax on a specific auction or the buyer provides us with a tax-exempt form, Minnesota sales tax will be charged on all purchases. Sales tax is computed on the combined amount of the winning bid and
				Buyer's Premium.</p>


			<h2>Sale Items Subject To Change</h2>

			<p>The auctioneer reserves the right to add items to or remove items from the auction at any time, even during the bidding process; to split or combine lots; to edit descriptions; to add or remove photos; to add minimum bids or reserve prices; to
				cancel, suspend, extend or reschedule an individual item and or an entire auction; or to change any auction's closing time, preview time, or pick-up time.</p>

			<h2>Late Pick-Ups</h2>

			<p>You agree to pick up your items at the regularly scheduled pick-up time for the involved auction. We know, however, that sometimes things come up that may make that difficult. In those cases, you must call us during the pick-up time or before
				and pay for your purchase with a credit card. Then, if requested, we will ship your items to you or we will hold them until the next scheduled pick-up day. If you do not pick up your items at the next scheduled pick-up day, we will re-sell them
				on your behalf at our regular rates.</p>

			<p>If you miss pick-up and you do not call us during pick-up time or before, we will cancel the sale of your items and you will lose your bidding privileges. If you call us later and ask for your items, it shall be within our discretion to sell
				the items to you or not. If we still have them and agree to sell them to you, you must pay for them with a credit card during your call to us and we will charge you a $10.00 late pick-up fee. The pick-up shall then take place during the next
				scheduled pick-up day at AAA Auction. If you pay for your items but do not pick them up as described, you authorize AAA Auction to re-sell them for you at the next available auction at our regular rates.</p>

			<p>If you fail to pick up an item that you have won, and if your credit card has not been charged for the item, we reserve the right to re-sell the item for the Seller. If we do that and if the winning bid amount is less than the winning bid from
				the auction in which you were the winning bidder, you authorize us to charge your credit card the amount of the deficiency. For example, if you won the item for $50 and the next time we sold it, the high bid was $40, then you authorize us to
				charge your credit card $10.00.</p>

			<p>It shall be within the discretion of AAA Auction whether to reinstate your bidding privileges if they have been canceled for any reason.</p>

			<h2>Shipping</h2>

			<p>We will be happy to ship most items if asked to do so. If you would like an item shipped, you must call us at (763) 421-3044 or e-mail us at info@auctionmn.com before or during the regularly scheduled pick-up time and provide us with your
				shipping instructions and credit card information to pay for the items. Your credit card will then be charged the amount stated on your invoice. Your credit card will be charged again later when the shipping costs have been determined. The
				shipping cost shall be the fees charged by the shipper such as the post office plus insurance plus reasonable handling charges which shall be $9.00 for envelopes and USPS boxes. The handling fee shall be more than $9.00 for non-USPS boxes.
				Shipping costs for non-USPS boxes shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. AAA Auction shall place insurance on the package in an amount as close as possible to the invoice total of the item. Any claim against AAA Auction and Realty, LLC
				shall be limited to the insurance placed upon the package during shipping.</p>

			<p>We reserve the right to not ship an item for any reason such as the size or fragile nature of the item. So, if you are bidding on something that would be difficult to ship, please call us before the auction closes to find out if we can ship
				the item or not. If we cannot ship the item, you will need to arrange another shipping method. Large items cost a lot to ship, so please consider that when bidding. If the successful bidder decides not to pay the shipping costs or pick up the
				item won, he or she is still required to pay the full amount stated on the invoice. We will then resell the item at the same commission on behalf of the winning bidder at a subsequent auction.</p>

			<h2>Gun Sale Terms</h2>

			<p>Firearms are dangerous. By purchasing a firearm from AAA Auction you agree to follow the manufacturer's safety instructions and to only use the firearm safely in an approved area for a legal purpose. You are assuming all responsibility for the
				legality of a specific item when you purchase it. You are responsible for checking all federal, state and local laws before bidding on or using a firearm purchased from AAA Auction.</p>

			<p>AAA Auction is a licensed federal firearms dealer. As such, federal and state gun laws apply. The following is a summary of the law. It is not an exhaustive summary of the laws.</p>

			<p><strong>Background Check.</strong> The Buyer of any gun at AAA Auction must fill out a Form 4473 that will allow AAA Auction to run a background check on the Buyer. This usually takes about 15 minutes. A Buyer’s driver’s license is usually
				required. The policy at AAA Auction is to receive full payment for the gun before the background check is run. If the response from the FBI is “Proceed”, the gun shall be transferred to the Buyer at that time. If the response from the FBI is
				“Delay”, the gun will be kept by AAA Auction until we receive the final decision from the FBI; however, if three business days pass since the original “Delay” response, and if no subsequent “Denied” response has been received by AAA Auction, AAA
				Auction shall then transfer the gun to the Buyer. If the response from the FBI to the background check is ‘Deny”, the Buyer shall not be entitled to a refund. Rather, AAA Auction shall retain possession of the gun and shall sell it at the next
				available auction for the Buyer (now Seller) at the regular rates being charged at that time.</p>

			<p><strong>Age.</strong> Buyers of rifles and shotguns must be 18 years old. Buyers of handguns and rifles with pistol grips (assault-type weapons), must be 21 years old.</p>

			<p><strong>Handguns and Assault-Style Rifles</strong> Buyers of handguns and assault-style rifles must have a permit to purchase, a carry permit or an FFL license. If the Buyer purchases a handgun without the necessary permit, the Buyer shall pay
				for the gun and AAA Auction shall retain possession of the gun for up to one month. At any time during the month the Buyer produces a qualifying permit or license, AAA Auction shall transfer the gun to the Buyer subject to an FBI background
				check. If a month goes by and the Buyer has not produced a qualifying permit or license, then AAA Auction and shall sell the gun at the next available auction for the Buyer (now Seller) at the regular rates being charged at that time.</p>

			<p><strong>Out of State Buyers.</strong> AAA will sell guns to out of state buyers; however, the guns must be shipped to a licensed dealer where the transfer will take place and where a background check will be done. The AAA Buyer must provide
				AAA Auction with the name, phone number, and address of the dealer to whom the gun will be shipped. The AAA Buyer must also have the receiving dealer email a copy of his or her FFL license to tony@auctionmn.com. The email should also contain the
				name of the AAA Auction customer. There likely will be a fee charged to the AAA buyer by the receiving dealer. Shipping and handling fees shall apply. Black Power and Guns Made Before 1898. No background checks are required for black powder guns
				and guns made in or before 1898.</p>

			<p><strong>Buyer.</strong> The Buyer at AAA Auction must be the actual Buyer of the gun. Guns will not be sold to a person buying the gun for another person.</p>

			<p><strong>Background Checks on Sellers.</strong> If any gun must be returned to a Seller (such as the gun not selling due to not meeting a reserve) AAA Auction is required to run a background check on the Seller. The procedure for a background
				check on the Seller is the same as for a Buyer as stated described above.</p>

			<p><strong>Case</strong> If your purchase did not include a case, then please bring an appropriate case for transporting your purchase from AAA Auction.</p>

			<h2>Misc. Terms</h2>

			<p>Any alcohol contained in a collectible bottle is not sold for consumption and will not be sold to anyone under 21 years of age.</p>

			<p>AAA Auction disclaims any knowledge of the history of any ammunition sold. AAA Auction does not know how old the ammo is or whether the ammo has been reloaded. Use it at your own risk. AAA Auction disclaims any liability arising out of the use
				of said ammunition.</p>

			<h2>Hold Harmless</h2>

			<p>Bidder does hereby indemnify and hold harmless the Auctioneer and the Seller from any damages, claims, or liabilities from injuries to persons or property of any type whatsoever, caused before, during, or after the auction.</p>

			<h2>With Reserve</h2>

			<p>All auctions and auction items by law in Minnesota are with reserve unless stated as absolute. This means that the Seller may bid on his items and the Auctioneer and his staff reserve the right to bid on and purchase items in this auction as
				well.</p>

			<h2>Internet Service</h2>

			<p>We do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted access to our services. The operation of the website and services may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. AAA Auction is not responsible for lost or misdirected e-mails,
				slowness in the transmission of bids, technical difficulties that result in loss of Bidder's internet connection with www.auctionmn.com, or other technical problems. AAA Auction is not responsible for any difficulties that may occur in the
				proper or timely transmission or access of e-mail forwarded to any e-mail address. The vagaries of the Internet, spam filters, lack of storage space, and rules set by different Internet service providers are all additional factors which may fail
				to deliver e-mails as expected.</p>

			<h2>Records</h2>

			<p>Unless otherwise stated, we have not sound tested the records and any statement regarding the condition of any record is our opinion only and are not a guarantee. We have checked to make sure that the correct record is in the correct jacket
				for any jacket shown in the photos. We recommend that bidders come to the scheduled preview to inspect the records and play them on our equipment if desired.</p>

			<!-- <p>We are not record appraisers; however, in our opinion, all records and covers in lots of 1, 2 or 3 are in good, very good or excellent condition. We have not sound tested the records, but we have checked to make sure that the correct record is in the correct jacket. Our statement as to the condition of any record is our opinion only and are not a guarantee. We recommend that bidders come to the scheduled preview to inspect the records and play them on our equipment if desired.</p> -->

			<!-- <p>Records sold in lots of 4 or more may not necessarily be in good condition or better. Some records or jackets may have condition issues or may simply be by less popular artists. Once again, inspection is recommended.</p> -->

			<h2>Terms May Change</h2>

			<p>All terms and conditions are subject to change.</p>
