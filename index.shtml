    <p><strong>Auctioneer's Notes</strong></p>
      <p>Attention wood crafters and handymen. This auction is for you. This auction offers you the chance to bid on woodshop equipment that has been expertly maintained and stored in a heated, humidity controlled shop in Oak Grove. Everything works and is in excellent condition. It is being sold because our seller is moving.</p>
      <p>You will see that some of the items in this auction have reserves. That means that the seller has giving us his bottom price to sell the item. If at the end of the auction that amount has not been bid, then item will not sell at the close of the auction. After the auction closes and later that evening, we will post on our website whether the reserve has been met. If the reserve has not been met, then anyone is welcome to call AAA Auction at (763) 427-7101 by 4 pm on March 3rd and make an offer to buy the item at the reserve amount. If your offer is accepted, we will ask you for a credit card at that time. A 3% convenience fee will be added to the total. Pick-up will then be arranged to take place in the near future.</p>
      <p>Please note that this is a small auction and that therefore we will be closing the auction at the rate of one item per minute.</p>
      <p>The seller’s driveway will allow the buyer to back a truck or a small-sized trailer right up to the shop door. There are no steps. Please bring help to load your purchase. <b>AAA Auction staff does not provide loading assistance.</b></p>
      <p>Once again, we are using SignUpGenious to schedule preview and pick-up times. You are able right now to reserve a 15-minute time slot to preview the items in person on Feb. 23 rd from 4 pm to 7 pm. Once the auction has ended, you will then be able to schedule a 15-minute pick-up time on March 3 rd from 9 am until 4 pm. If it is not possible for you to pickup your item at the scheduled time, please call AAA Auction to make other arrangements.</p>
      <p>Thank you in advance for masking up and maintaining safe social distancing.</p>

    <p><strong>Auctioneer's Notes</strong></p>
      <p>Thank you everyone for using SignUpGenius to schedule the pick-up of your items. Not only does that help us keep a clean and safe environment, but it also reduces your wait time when you are here. Also, if you prefer not to use SignUpGenius, please call us and we will schedule a time for you.</p>
      <p>Also, the company who hosts our auctions is changing it's format very soon. We have no choice in this and we are hoping that it will enhance your bidding experience with AAA Auction. We will know more next month. For this auction though, everything will remain the same.</p>
    <p><strong>New Terms</strong></p>
    <p>Late Pick-Ups With Call to AAA:</p>
      <p>You agree to pick up your items at the regularly scheduled pick-up time for the involved auction. We know, however, that sometimes things come up that may make that difficult. In those cases, you must call us during the scheduled pick-up time or before and pay for your purchase with a credit card. We will then hold your items for you until the next scheduled pick-up day. Unless otherwise agreed, if you do not pick up your items by the next scheduled pick-up day, you shall pay AAA Auction storage fees of $5 per day commencing two weeks after the original pick-up day that you missed. If you do not pick up your items by the time the storage fees exceed the amount of your purchase, your items shall be considered abandoned by you and you shall forfeit any interest in or claims arising out of those items.</p>
      <p>Missed Pick-up and no Call to AAA:</p>
      <p>If you miss pick-up and you do not call us during pick-up time or before, we will cancel the sale of your items and you will lose your bidding privileges. If you call us later and ask for your items, it shall be within our discretion to sell the items to you or not. If we still have them and agree to sell them to you, you must pay for them with a credit card during your call to us and we will charge you a $10.00 late  fee. The pick-up shall then take place during the next scheduled pick-up day at AAA Auction. If you pay for your items but do not pick them up as described, the above paragraph shall apply. It shall be within the discretion of AAA Auction whether to reinstate your bidding privileges if they have been canceled for any reason.</p>

  <h2 id="maus">Mau's Corner Flea Market & Live Auction</h2>
  <p><b>Hello Mau's Corner Auction Sellers and Bidders.</b></p>
  <p>Well, it looks like we will not be holding any auctions at Mau's Corner this year. Let's hope that the Corona virus gets under control and we can get back to normal next Spring.</p>
  <!-- <p>As much as we would like to start our Tuesday auctions again, it realistically looks like the soonest that might occur maybe this Fall. We apologize that we are not able to provide live auction services at this time; however, we are
    once again holding online auctions at the Auction Barn in Nowthen. Please call (763) 421-3044 if you would like to consign with us for our next online auction.</p> -->
  <p>Thank you.</p>

          <!-- <p><strong>Auctioneer's Notes</strong></p>
  <p>For 2019, although not required, we request that consignors call us before the auction to reserve a space to sell. The earlier you call, the closer to the front of the auction you will be. You have to arrive by 6 am though to claim your
    reserved space. You are still welcome to sell even if you can't call us before the auction. We will schedule an auction only when it looks like we will have enough items for a good auction. We will post the date of the next auction on
    our website, on Facebook and also on our sign at Mau's Corner. You can also phone us at (763) 421-3044 as early as 4:30 am on Tuesdays. See you there!</p> -->

        <h2><a href="https://www.auctionmn.com/testimonials.shtml">Testimonials</a></h2>

        <p><i>I have known Tony and Denise as friends and as colleagues since they began their auction business in 2005 and I have to say not only do they run an excellent auction house, but they are also some of the nicest and most honest people I have ever met. In my case, after running my own estate sale company, Gently Kept, for many years, it became necessary for me to retire and as you might have guessed I had a lot-and I mean a lot- of stuff to sell. My house was full. My 4-car garage was full and my shed was full. I called Tony and he promised that he could empty it all and have my house ready for the market in a month or so. He then had one online auction at my house and moved trailer loads of my items to his auction barn where he sold them over a period of several months. I could not have been happier with the speed, the thoroughness and the prices that AAA Auction got for me. Thank you Tony and Denise and AAA Auction.</i></p>

        <!-- <p><i>AAA Auction and Realty Company was instrumental in my downsizing process due to old age. Mr. Elfelt collected much of my shop equipment and gun collection and auctioned it off. His company was very successful in getting top dollar for
            the items. Tony Elfelt kept me informed of the progress. Checks were issued very promptly as property sold. Then gun collection was auctioned off nationally, including Hawaii. It was very successful. I recommend AAA Auction and Realty
            Company to anyone who needs to downsize.</i></p>

            auction bill you put together for us. Thanks too to Gary who cleaned up everything for the next several days and got our house ready to turn over to the new buyers. We will miss Minnesota but mostly we'll miss the great friends we made
            here
            including you folks at AAA Auction.</i></p>
        <p>- Sheila and Bruce Parson</p> -->

        <!-- <p><i>Wow! I didn’t know retired guys could work so hard. Thanks for all the help you gave us in emptying our house and sheds so we could close on our sale. We are very happy with the services you provided including getting our huge dinosaur
            TV out of the lower level of our home. You guys are unbelievable and friendly too. We know a lot of people these days who are down-sizing and we will be happy to send them your way.</i></p>
        <p>- The Andersons</p> -->

        <!-- <p><i>I want to take a moment to thank you for the great work AAA Auction did for me. As you know, my wife and I are moving and after 40 years our house and buildings were full of stuff. Since we are only taking a small amount of things with us, we needed to sell everything and empty out our house so it could be sold. We are extremely happy with the prompt work AAA Auction did to assist us. You respected our home when you were there working and you made a very fair deal with me. Actually, we are very relieved that you guys dug in and not only removed the good clean items, but the lower value items too. We don't know what we would have done without you. Thank you.</i></p>

        <!-- <p><i>"When my husband died, the task of organizing and selling his business and hobbies seemed overwhelming. AAA Auction was recommended to me by a good friend, so I called. I met with Tony right away and he was able to form a plan to help me take care of everything. He listened to all my concerns and always put my needs first. Tony and his extremely able crew went to work immediately. Everyone involved has been respectful, honest and trustworthy. They have been wonderful to work with and I cannot recommend them highly enough!"</i></p>

        <!-- <p><i>"My sister and I hired a traditional estate sale company to sell the contents of our parents’ home. Due to several reasons, the estate sale company only sold a small amount of the items. We then contacted Tony at AAA Auction to see if he would be interested in purchasing the entire estate. We couldn’t have been more pleased with Tony and his crew. They came over as soon as we called and performed a careful evaluation of the contents. We then came to an agreement that had AAA Auction remove everything from the home in about 10 days. All in all, Tony and his staff treated us with fairness, understanding and respect during a difficult time and I would strongly recommend them to anyone with estate sale needs."</i></p>

        <!-- <p><i>"Thank you for all your help with the gala this year! You do a wonderful job and we definitely would not be as successful without you!"</i></p>
		<p>-Tina Stofferahn</p> -->
        <!-- 		<p><i>"Thanks Tony – We certainly wouldn't be as successful as we are if we didn't have you in the picture."</i></p>
