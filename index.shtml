          <!-- <p><strong>Auctioneer's Notes</strong></p>
  <p>For 2019, although not required, we request that consignors call us before the auction to reserve a space to sell. The earlier you call, the closer to the front of the auction you will be. You have to arrive by 6 am though to claim your
    reserved space. You are still welcome to sell even if you can't call us before the auction. We will schedule an auction only when it looks like we will have enough items for a good auction. We will post the date of the next auction on
    our website, on Facebook and also on our sign at Mau's Corner. You can also phone us at (763) 421-3044 as early as 4:30 am on Tuesdays. See you there!</p> -->

        <p><i>Wow! I didn’t know retired guys could work so hard. Thanks for all the help you gave us in emptying our house and sheds so we could close on our sale. We are very happy with the services you provided including getting our huge dinosaur
            TV out of the lower level of our home. You guys are unbelievable and friendly too. We know a lot of people these days who are down-sizing and we will be happy to send them your way.</i></p>
        <p>- The Andersons</p>

        <!-- <p><i>I want to take a moment to thank you for the great work AAA Auction did for me. As you know, my wife and I are moving and after 40 years our house and buildings were full of stuff. Since we are only taking a small amount of things with us, we needed to sell everything and empty out our house so it could be sold. We are extremely happy with the prompt work AAA Auction did to assist us. You respected our home when you were there working and you made a very fair deal with me. Actually, we are very relieved that you guys dug in and not only removed the good clean items, but the lower value items too. We don't know what we would have done without you. Thank you.</i></p>
		<p>Tom LeMon</p> -->

        <!-- <p><i>"When my husband died, the task of organizing and selling his business and hobbies seemed overwhelming. AAA Auction was recommended to me by a good friend, so I called. I met with Tony right away and he was able to form a plan to help me take care of everything. He listened to all my concerns and always put my needs first. Tony and his extremely able crew went to work immediately. Everyone involved has been respectful, honest and trustworthy. They have been wonderful to work with and I cannot recommend them highly enough!"</i></p>
		<p>- Wendy Richardson</p> -->

        <!-- <p><i>"My sister and I hired a traditional estate sale company to sell the contents of our parents’ home. Due to several reasons, the estate sale company only sold a small amount of the items. We then contacted Tony at AAA Auction to see if he would be interested in purchasing the entire estate. We couldn’t have been more pleased with Tony and his crew. They came over as soon as we called and performed a careful evaluation of the contents. We then came to an agreement that had AAA Auction remove everything from the home in about 10 days. All in all, Tony and his staff treated us with fairness, understanding and respect during a difficult time and I would strongly recommend them to anyone with estate sale needs."</i></p>
		<p>- Ann Fuller and her sister, Lynn</p> -->

        <!-- <p><i>"Thank you for all your help with the gala this year! You do a wonderful job and we definitely would not be as successful without you!"</i></p>
		<p>-Tina Stofferahn</p> -->
        <!-- 		<p><i>"Thanks Tony – We certainly wouldn't be as successful as we are if we didn't have you in the picture."</i></p>
