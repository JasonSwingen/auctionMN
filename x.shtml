 All items are sold "AS IS", "WHERE IS", and "FINAL," with no 
warranties, express or implied. Illustrations, pictures, sounds, or 
videos posted on AAA Auction's web site are for identification purposes 
only and are not warranties of any type. All measurements are 
approximate and AAA Auction encourages bidders to preview our auctions 
and measure items themselves. AAA Auction does not guarantee the 
authenticity of any item, including autographs. Many specific 
descriptions are provided by the sellers and are assumed to be true; 
however, AAA Auction does not know whether the descriptions provided by 
sellers are correct. AAA Auction does not know whether some items are 
reproductions or originals. Please note that items seen in the 
photographs are not included in the lot unless specifically mentioned in
 the description. Buyer assumes complete and sole responsibility for 
inspection of items prior to bidding and relies solely on his or her own
 inspection as to the condition, authenticity, and value of items. Buyer
 waives any and all claims against AAA Auction and seller based on the 
condition or value of items.<br> <br> We accept cash, good checks, 
cashier's checks, Visa, and MasterCard. Two forms of ID are needed for 
checks, with at least one being a photo ID. No out-of-state checks. 
There is a $30.00 fee on all returned checks. Credit cards will be 
accepted up to $5,000. Unless prior arrangements are made, coins must be
 paid for with cash, and titled items must be paid for with cash, an 
approved Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover Card, a cashier's 
check, or a personal check with a bank letter of guarantee. Checks in an
 amount over $5,000 must be guaranteed with a valid credit card and not a
 check card.<br> <br> AAA Auction requires a valid credit card in order 
to guarantee all online bids. Of course, bidders may pay for their 
purchases with cash or a good check in person at the live auction or 
scheduled pickup time. Bidder agrees that AAA Auction may charge the 
buyer's credit card for any purchase for which payment has not been 
received and which has not been picked up at the scheduled pickup time. 
Buyer shall call AAA Auction and advise AAA Auction if buyer is unable 
to pick up at the scheduled time. AAA Auction will then reschedule your 
pick up within the next two days.<br> <br> <font color="#cc0000">All 
late pickups shall be assessed a $2 per day late pickup fee with a $10 
minimum fee which shall be charged to buyer's credit card.</font><br> <br>
 If the winning bidder has paid for his items, but does not pick up his 
items at the scheduled pickup time, or within two business days 
following the close of the auction, or at such other time as may be 
agreed to by AAA Auction, then that winning bidder authorizes AAA 
Auction to re-list the items not picked up and sell them again on behalf
 of the winning bidder at the prevailing standard commission rate. The 
winning bidder shall also be barred from participating in future 
auctions at AAA Auction.<br> <br> If the winning bidder breaches the 
bidding contract by failing to pay for his items, then he shall be 
barred from bidding in the future and is also liable for damages. 
Bidders agree that damages shall be liquidated and shall equal 35% of 
the total winning bids made by the buyer for which payment has not been 
made.<br> <br> There is a 13% buyer's premium on all auction purchases 
after receiving a 3% discount for paying with cash or check. All 
purchases paid with a credit card or a check card shall have a buyer's 
premium of 16%.<br> <br> Minnesota and county sales tax applies to this auction. The sales tax also applies to the buyer's premium.<br> <br>
 The auctioneer reserves the right to add items to or remove items from 
the auction; to split or combine lots; to edit descriptions; to add or 
remove photos; to add minimum bids or reserve prices; to cancel, 
suspend, extend or reschedule an individual item and or an entire 
auction; or to change an auction's closing time, preview time, or pickup
 time.<br> <br> The buyer of any titled vehicle shall provide AAA 
Auction with all necessary information and fees to complete a title 
transfer. In addition to the regular State of Minnesota transfer fees 
for titled vehicles and trailers, the buyer of each titled vehicle or 
trailer shall also pay AAA Auction a $20 processing fee for the title 
transfer.<br> <br> Federal and State Firearms Licensing Rules apply to 
firearms sales. If you are buying a handgun, then you also must have a 
purchase permit, carry permit, or a federal firearms license. All guns 
must leave the Auction Center in a case. Please bring a case if you are 
buying a gun. If you do not have a long case, AAA will supply one to you
 for $2.00. Any gun buyer who does not pass the background check 
authorizes the auctioneer to resell the gun for him, with a standard 
commission to be charged.<br> <br> AAA Auction disclaims any knowledge 
of the history of any ammunition sold. AAA Auction does not know how old
 the ammo is or whether the ammo has been reloaded. Use at your own 
risk. AAA Auction disclaims any liability arising out of the use of said
 ammunition.<br> <br> All auctions and auction items by law in Minnesota
 are with reserve unless stated as absolute. Sellers, and Auctioneer and
 his staff reserve the right to bid on and purchase items in this 
auction. <br> <br> Bidder does hereby indemnify and hold harmless the 
Auctioneer and the Seller from any and all damages, claims, or 
liabilities from injuries to persons or property of any type whatsoever,
 caused before, during, or after the auction.<br> <br> All terms and conditions are subject to change.<br><br><i><font color="#cc0000">If
