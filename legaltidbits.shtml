and ATV Crashes<br>
</b></font><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4"><b>February 6, 2013</b></font><big style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
<br>
In 2012 in Minnesota&nbsp;six people&nbsp;</big><big style="font-family: Arial;">were</big><big style="font-family: Arial;"> killed on snowmobiles, 17
people were killed on ATVs and countless more people were seriously
injured in recreational crashes.&nbsp; Just as with motorcycles,
many of the injuries were the result of alcohol or inexperience.<br>
<br>
What if it happens to you? Can you sue? Is there anything you should
do? Yes &#8211; call the experienced lawyers at Erhart and
Elfelt
right away for a free consultation at (763) 444-4444. We will ask you
two basic questions:<br>
1. What is your injury? <br>
2.&nbsp;How did it happen?<br>
<br>
Hopefully your answers will be that your injury is minor and that it
was the other person&#8217;s fault because in Minnesota you cannot sue
yourself for your own negligence. So, if you were at fault in causing
your own injury, you cannot collect anything for your pain and
suffering from anyone. However, your private medical insurance should
pay your medical bills even if you caused the crash yourself.<br>
<br>
But if you have the misfortune though of being injured because someone
else was at fault, then you will have a claim against that person for
your loss. This includes a claim for your medical bills, wage loss,
disability, pain and suffering and property damage. Also if that person
has homeowner&#8217;s coverage, there is a very good chance that his or her
homeowner&#8217;s insurance company will be responsible for your injuries.<br>
<br>
Call Erhart and Elfelt right away at (763) 444-4444 for a free
consultation because as soon as the other person&#8217;s insurance company
learns about your injury, it will send out its investigators to try to
gather evidence to prove the crash was your fault. Allowing Erhart and
Elfelt to get involved in a case early can often be the difference in
being able to prove it was the other person&#8217;s fault or not.&nbsp; <br>

Insurance
policies are written by insurance companies to benefit themselves. So
is it any surprise that they are full of traps that can trip up an
honest person trying his best to make a fair and reasonable claim? This
is especially true with claims for losses due to house fires and
therefore it is extremely important that you contact Erhart and Elfelt
immediately after a fire; and in fact, a call to us even before you
call your insurance company could save you thousands of dollars. <br>

Driving Injuries<br>
</b></font><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4"><b>December 28, 2012</b></font><big style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
<br>
In
2011, 111 people in Minnesota were killed and 2,375 were injured by
drunk drivers. At Erhart and Elfelt, we not only go after the drunk
driver for our clients' injuries, but we also go after the bars that
served alcohol to the drunk driver. The "dram shop law" in Minnesota
says that it is illegal for a bar to serve a person who is showing
obvious signs of intoxication. If a bar breaks that law and serves
alcohol to someone who is already intoxicated, the bar can be held
responsible for the injuries caused by the drunk driver. Most of the
time, however, bartenders and servers are trained not to admit to
anyone that they served a drunk person, so prompt and skillful
investigation is needed to prove that they did. At Erhart and Elfelt we
are experienced in investigating and suing bars who risk the lives of
everyone on the road simply to make a few extra dollars by breaking the
dram shop law and serving alcohol to someone who is already drunk. </big><big style="font-family: Arial;"><br>

Bites<br>
</b></font><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4"><b>December 27, 2012</b></font><big style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
<br>
We
don't bring dog bite claims to punish the owners of the dogs and often
the dogs that bite are not evil, mean dogs. You don't have to be a
child or a mailman to be bitten and you don't have to be teasing the
dog or be a stranger to be bitten. Any dog can bite and anyone can be
bitten. That is why most homeowners' insurance policies cover dog
bites; however, you need a lawyer to make sure the insurance company
makes a fair offer to you. <br>
<br>
In every injury case, we gather
evidence to prove that the incident occurred and that the other
person's insurance company should pay. We also gather all of the
evidence to prove the actual out-of-pocket loss such as for medical
bills and wage loss. After that, we help you tell your story of pain
and suffering to the insurance company or jury. This is especially
important in dog bite cases because in those cases, the loss a person
suffers is often not so much the out-of-pocket expenses as it is the
emotional trauma from the attack and the psychological harm from
physical scars.<br>
<br>
At Erhart and Elfelt we represent adults and
children with horrendous scars or a simple puncture wound. Someone once
said that the only small scar is one on somebody else. At Erhart and
Elfelt we don't judge whether a person should be suffering or not.
Rather, we learn as much as we can about our clients and about how the
dog bite has affected them. We then make sure that our client's full
story is told to the insurance company and that our clients are treated
fairly.<br>

Crashes<br>
</b></font><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4"><b>December 22, 2012</b></font><br>
<big style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
According
to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, there were 72,117
reported car crashes in Minnesota in 2011 with 368 deaths and over
30,000 injuries. Also, from our 60+ years of experience dealing with
crash victims and insurance companies, we cannot think of one time when
an insurance company has offered an injured person a fair settlement
unless he or she were represented by a good lawyer. <br>
<br>
We believe
that accidents usually don't just happen. They are usually caused by
one or more people being careless. We also believe that if someone else
causes you to suffer personally or financially, then that person (or
his insurance company) should pay for the harm he or she has caused.
However, insurance companies make money by not doing the right and
responsible thing and that is why thousands of injured people have
relied on Tony Elfelt and Bill Erhart over the years to help them reach
just and fair settlements for their injury claims.<br>
<br>
In personal
injury cases, the law firm of Erhart and Elfelt charges a fee only when
you win or settle your claim. They will meet you when and where it is
convenient for you and they encourage you to call them as soon as
possible after a crash, even if you don't yet know how badly you are
hurt.<br>

<big style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
Every
fall hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans spend time in the woods, on
the water, or in the fields hunting, and every year there are a number
of accidental shootings and even deaths caused by the negligent
discharge of a firearm. We hunt too, and we know how important hunting
safety is. Yet accidents still happen when unforeseen things occur like
a stumble or an excited hunter shooting before checking the background.
Our firm handles cases like this and has successfully obtained
homeowners insurance settlements for the injured person.<br>

<big style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
Did
you know that in the USA over 1,000 people go to the emergency room
every year for dog bites and that 31 of them die? Dog bites happen
regularly and often lead to medical bills, pain, emotional suffering,
and scarring. Even nice dogs sometimes bite.<br>
<br>
The good thing is
that most homeowner's insurance policies cover dog bites. However, if
you have a dog, you should call your insurance agent and ask because
some insurance companies have been quietly removing that protection
from homeowner's insurance policies.<br>

</font></big><big style="font-family: Arial;">Did
you know that you are responsible for any damage caused by your car no
matter who is driving (unless you can prove it was stolen)?<br>
That
falls under Minnesota's Safety Responsibility Act. For example, if you
allow your child to drive your car, and if he or she allows one of his
or her friends to drive, you are financially responsible if your
child's friend negligently causes a crash.<br>
<br>
And did you know that you are personally responsible for any of the
damage that exceeds your limits of insurance?<br>
<br>
What's the moral of the story?<br>
</big>
<ul>
<li><big style="font-family: Arial;">Make sure
your children don't allow any of their friends to drive.</big></li>
<li><big style="font-family: Arial;">Make
sure you have plenty of insurance coverage. To determine how much is
enough, call your insurance agent or call us at (763) 444-4444.</big></li>

<big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
</font></big><big style="font-family: Arial;">Hello
Bidders,<br>
<br>
Many
of you know that I am also a lawyer. My law office is on Main Street
across from the Anoka Government Center where I work with Bill Erhart
in our law firm called Erhart and Elfelt, LLC.&nbsp; For over 30
years,
my law practice has involved protecting the rights of injured people.
This has mainly focused on making sure my clients' bills get paid and
that they are fairly compensated for injuries caused by other people. I
have handled thousands of cases ranging from neck and back pain to
broken bones, paralysis and death. There is no charge to talk with me,
so if you or someone you know could use some good legal advice, please
call me at (763) 444-4444.<br>
<br>
Also, many people who come to the
Auction Center are there because the responsibility of handling a
deceased person's estate has fallen to them. When that happens, there
are often other legal concerns that go beyond selling the personal
property. When that happens, I refer those people to my partner, Bill
Erhart. Bill has over 33 years of experience assisting people with
drawing up their wills and handling probate matters. He is thorough,
smart and tough when it&#8217;s required and you can also reach him at (763)
444-4444. If you mention that you saw this note, you will receive a
free 1/2 hour estate planning consultation. <br>
<br>
Finally, watch
this column for updates by Bill or me regarding interesting
developments in personal injury and estate planning law.<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
<br>
Tony Elfelt<br>
