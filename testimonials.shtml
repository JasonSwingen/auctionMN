			<h1>Our Clients Say It Best...</h1>

			<blockquote>I used AAA Auction for a large Gun sale and I have to say that I couldn't have been any Happier with Tony and his staff and was really Happy with the Auction results. Right from the beginning, Tony explained the process and what I
				could expect. The auction listings were pretty specific and done perfectly as were the photos of the items and they really highlighted each item and added to the sale for both the seller and the online buyer. Communication throughout the Auction
				was Great and ALL my questions were answered and Tony was VERY responsive to all my inquiries before, during and after the sale. The Auction staff was also excellent in providing constant updates when asked and did a GREAT job in making the
				complex sale of multiple firearms a Huge SUCCESS. Fair, Honest and Seller oriented Auction staff here....Tony and his staff work for the Seller to ensure a Great and Successful auction. Highly recommend for any sales you might be considering of
				personal items, estates and like me firearms. The payment was prompt and auction fees were very reasonable for everything AAA Auction did to make my sale a Great success....Thanks again for everything

			<blockquote> AAA Auction and Realty Company was instrumental in my downsizing process due to old age. Mr. Elfelt collected much of my shop equipment and gun collection and auctioned it off. His company was very successful in getting top dollar
				for
				the items. Tony Elfelt kept me informed of the progress. Checks were issued very promptly as property sold. Then gun collection was auctioned off nationally, including Hawaii. It was very successful. I recommend AAA Auction and Realty
				Company to anyone who needs to downsize.</blockquote>
			<p>- Sincerely Alton G. "Chuck" Drury</p>


			<blockquote>Thank you so very much for doing our auction. Although the weather was cold and rainy, we still had a good auction. Thank you too for all the canopies you brought and for all the advertising that you did. I especially liked the large
				auction bill you put together for us. Thanks too to Gary who cleaned up everything for the next several days and got our house ready to turn over to the new buyers. We will miss Minnesota but mostly we'll miss the great friends we made here
				including you folks at AAA Auction.</blockquote>

			<p>- Sheila and Bruce Parson</p>

			<blockquote>Thanks Tony for your suggestions, and thanks for your support of Family Enhancement Center. I really appreciated your commitment to our Gala, including meeting with us beforehand, your 24 hour response to our questions, and your list
				of suggestions for our next year's Gala. Oh, and did I mention your ability to raise significant donations through the Live Auction, Fund the Need and last but not least, the Surprise Bonus Game! I especially liked the Surprise Bonus Game
				because it was highly entertaining while engaging attendees and raising donations. Thanks so much for helping our agency to surpass our financial goal which supports our mission of creating strong families and safe kids.
			</blockquote>
			<p>- Mary Serie, Family Enhancement Center</p>

			<blockquote>Wow! I didn’t know retired guys could work so hard. Thanks for all the help you gave us in emptying our house and sheds so we could close on our sale. We are very happy with the services you provided including getting our huge
				dinosaur TV out of the lower level of our home. You guys are unbelievable and friendly too. We know a lot of people these days who are down-sizing and we will be happy to send them your way.</blockquote>
			<p>- The Andersons (Ham Lake)</p>

			<blockquote>I want to take a moment to thank you for the great work AAA Auction did for me. As you know, my wife and I are moving and after 40 years our house and buildings were full of stuff. Since we are only taking a small amount of things
				with us, we needed to sell everything and empty out our house so it could be sold. We are extremely happy with the prompt work AAA Auction did to assist us. You respected our home when you were there working and you made a very fair deal with
				me. Actually, we are very relieved that you guys dug in and not only removed the good clean items, but the lower value items too. We don't know what we would have done without you. Thank you.
			</blockquote>
			<p>- Tom LeMon</p>

			<blockquote>My sister and I hired a traditional estate sale company to sell the contents of our parents’ home. Due to several reasons, the estate sale company only sold a small amount of the items. We then contacted Tony at AAA Auction to see if
				he would be interested in purchasing the entire estate. We couldn’t have been more pleased with Tony and his crew. They came over as soon as we called and performed a careful evaluation of the contents. We then came to an agreement that had AAA
				Auction remove everything from the home in about 10 days. All in all, Tony and his staff treated us with fairness, understanding and respect during a difficult time and I would strongly recommend them to anyone with estate sale needs.</blockquote>
			<p>- Ann Fuller and her sister, Lynn</p>

			<blockquote>When my husband died, the task of organizing and selling his business and hobbies seemed overwhelming. AAA Auction was recommended to me by a good friend, so I called. I met with Tony right away and he was able to form a plan to help
				me take care of everything. He listened to all my concerns and always put my needs first. Tony and his extremely able crew went to work immediately. Everyone involved has been respectful, honest and trustworthy. They have been wonderful to work
				with and I cannot recommend them highly enough!</blockquote>
			<p>- Wendy Richardson</p>

			<blockquote>I cannot possibly thank you enough for all your help in making the 2015 gala such a success! Thank you again for all your help with the gala this year! You do a wonderful job and we definitely would not be as successful without you!</blockquote>
			<p>- Tina Stofferah</p>

			<blockquote>Thanks Tony - coming from you, who have attended countless numbers of these events your feedback is extremely appreciated! We certainly wouldn't be as successful as we are if we didn't have you in the picture. We have heard nothing
				but great comments on your leading us through the auction and fund-a-need. Again - it is our pleasure to work with you!</blockquote>
			<p>- Jill Munsinger</p>

			<blockquote>Denise, the auction just ended for my first coin lot.&nbsp; I am very pleased with the results. The prices realized were right where I wanted them to be - numismatic coin value. I want to say Thank You to you and your staff (please
				tell them for me). You guys did a great job. I appreciate it</blockquote>
			<p>- Asher Tristani, Online Auction Consignor</p>

			<blockquote>Tony, your presence made all the difference in the world! Our annual program had always been successful in raising support for Youth First, but with your gift of communicating a need and engaging the audience, we raised three times
				more than usual! Thanks, Tony, for your passion for the program and special touch that put this year's Annual Mayors' Prayer Breakfast over the top!</blockquote>
			<p>- Martha Weaver, Chairperson of the Board of Directors for Youth First</p>

			<blockquote>Denise, thanks for your prompt service in sending the check for the estate. And I also appreciate how thorough the voucher is. I like the good records that you and the auction company obviously keep. Put it all together and it adds up
				to me being glad to use your service in liquidating the Estate's personal property.</blockquote>
			<p>- T.M. from Maple Grove</p>

			<blockquote>As the CEO of Achieve Services, Inc. in Anoka County, I want to thank you for a fantastic auction. Thanks to your exceptional auction skills and persuasive approach during our Fund-a-Need, we far surpassed our goals. Too bad we have
				to wait a whole year to hold another gala and auction. Thanks again for a fun and profitable auction. You are a total ROCK STAR!!!</blockquote>
			<p>- Tom Weaver, CEO of Achieve Services</p>

			<blockquote>Wow, what a show! Many people came up to me afterwards and said that auctioneer was great. Thank you Tony for a fantastic job. We had no idea that the auction could be so successful and also be so much fun. Everyone loved your
				Auctioneer song too. Thanks again.</blockquote>
			<p>- Rick Ruprecht, Horizons Hunting and Fishing Ministry Wild Game Dinner and Revival</p>

			<blockquote>I just received my 2nd check from you for money that you found in my Aunt's personal belongings. The first check was quite a surprise, but the second one was amazing - thank you for being such an honest person and company.</blockquote>
			<p>- P. Y.</p>

			<blockquote>Tony has been an essential part of our fund-raising event team. I cannot say enough about the passion and energy he brings to our auction year after year. He believes in our purpose and does everything he can to make our auction a
				success.</blockquote>
			<p>- Colleen Pederson, Spring Lake Park Panther Foundation</p>

			<blockquote>Tony - Once again - you and your ring men were stellar in getting our crowd engaged and involved in the great auction items and most importantly, funding the science lab during our Wines to Wishes event. What you have done for our
				event and the school is simply remarkable. When I saw fund-a-need rolling as well as you predicted - it gave me goose bumps! I'd love to know how you were so confident we would be able to raise the money, given the bar was a good 5-6k higher
				than we raised last year!!! Regardless, you did it and I can't thank you enough! Again it was a pleasure to work with you - thanks for all of your great insight and guidance in getting us through the evening. We look forward to working with you
				again in 2014.</blockquote>
			<p>- Jill Munsinger, St. John the Baptist Church and School Benefit Auction</p>

			<blockquote>Tony did a fabulous job. We truly appreciate his dedication and integrity. He helped Anoka Rotary have their best year ever for fund-raising since we started. Tony and his team acted very professionally and we would love the
				opportunity to work with him again.</blockquote>
			<p>- Stacey Buchanan, Anoka Rotary Benefit Auction</p>

			<blockquote>Tony auctioneered our Anniversary Dinner live auction and did a wonderful job. His humor and auction expertise allows us to achieve the best results we have ever had for this event. We, at Anoka Rotary would highly recommend his skill
				and his integrity.</blockquote>
			<p>- Gary Campbell, Anoka Rotary Benefit Auction</p>

			<blockquote>Tony, a thousand thanks go to you and your crew! You all were dependable, prompt, and courteous. You gave us extremely fast service when we needed you....a real godsend.</blockquote>
			<p>- Gary and Judy Anderson, Estate Liquidation</p>

			<blockquote>Thank you for holding the storage unit auction that took place at AAA Movers a few weeks back. I was, to the best of my knowledge, the only buyer there that had been to a vault auction at this location in the past. As owner of a very
				large eBay store, The_Professor_Brandon, I go to auctions, storage units, estate, household auctions on a weekly basis as well as buy out many stores each year. The way you ran the auction, I was very impressed. You had a reasonable crowd, the
				right buyers, pulled reasonable prices, and ran it very professionally. This, compared to the other vault auctions I've been to was done very well and was a pleasure to go to.</blockquote>
			<p>- Brandon Sochor, Storage Vault Auction</p>

			<blockquote>Tony - two simple words - that carry so much meaning - THANK YOU! What you did for St. John the Baptist school and our Wines to Wishes event was amazing! Not to mention all the guidance and spot on advice you provided me personally
				leading into the event. We knew going in that you would be great, but the compliments keep coming in as to your ability to come in and command the attention of the crowd, be entertaining, and do a fabulous job for the event and school. Can't
				thank you enough! -- and I'm looking forward to your feedback -- as I know we can continue to improve. We'll be in contact soon.</blockquote>
			<p>- J. M., St. John the Baptist Benefit Auction</p>

			<blockquote>Tony, we want to thank you for our online auction! You taught us about something we knew nothing about. All things happened just like you said they would. You and your team were a delight to work with - they did the work and we
				watched. In the end all things were sold and we made more money than we expected. Thank you! We have already recommended you to our friends.</blockquote>
			<p>- Len and Joyce K., Online Estate Auction</p>

			<blockquote>What a night! The ZOOM House Benefit was held on a balmy April evening at Jax Cafe in Northeast Minneapolis and it was a grand success. Hearts were moved to make a difference in the lives of the families living at ZOOM House in a way
				that guarantees the program will continue for years to come. You gave us a quick lesson in "auctioneer speak" (can you say Betty's better butter made her bitter batter better, ten times, fast?). You quickly led the bidding through the dozen
				items in the live auction and on to the highlight of the evening - the Fund A Need. Thank you for sharing your gifts with us and helping to make this evening a huge success. You made a huge difference in our evening and in the lives of the
				residents of ZOOM House.</blockquote>
			<p>- Liza M. Anderson Schmid, ZOOM House Board</p>

			<blockquote>I wanted to say that we were very satisfied with your auction services. Numerous people commented to us about your professionalism and how fun it was to be there. We were especially impressed with how you often thanked the crowd for
				coming to our auction.</blockquote>
			<p>- Rick and Betty Piper, Personal Property Auction</p>

			<blockquote>I wanted to say thanks for the excellent job that your auction company did for our family. You and your staff did everything possible to make our estate sale a success. The combination of your auction center and on-line auction helped
				us sell all the items. I want to thank you for keeping us clearly informed of each step of the process, not having been through this before.</blockquote>
			<p>- Pat Terry, Estate Auction</p>

			<blockquote>Thank you for auctioneering for the Panther Foundation Gala. As a former auctioneer, I understand and appreciate the way you connected with the crowd to bring out the best bids! Your savvy memory serves you well in remembering folks
				from the last time your auctioneered two years ago and that brought a personal touch to the evening. Your idea of bringing the head football coach in to interact with the crowd at the optimum time during the bidding process made all the
				difference in obtaining the values we got for that item. It is this type of activity that sets you apart from your competition.</blockquote>
			<p>- Ed Krumme, Panther Foundation Gala, Spring Lake Park Schools</p>

			<blockquote>Tony was prompt at dealing with all aspects of the auction. He and his staff were knowledgeable and helpful. They cleaned up the area after the auction. I recommend AAA Auction and Realty to others who plan to have a personal property
				auction.</blockquote>
			<p>- Beth C. Olds, Personal Property Auction</p>

			<blockquote>Dear Tony: Thank you very much for the terrific job you and your staff did at my auction! Even though Mother Nature tried to soak the auction, the buyers were very happy that you brought walled tents to protect them from the wind and
				rain. We also had a great auction turnout thanks to your marketing and the friendly way you do business. Thanks again!</blockquote>
			<p>- Bob Simpson, Personal Property Auction</p>

			<blockquote>I do not have the words to say how much I would like to thank you or to describe my admiration of you as a wonderful person. All the work you have done for us was incredible to watch. Thank you isn't enough from us. I hope we bump
				into you again another day somehow.</blockquote>
			<p>- Annette Grillo, Sale of House and Personal Property</p>

			<blockquote>Thank you for a great job at the auction on Friday night. Tony was a great auctioneer! He kept everyone's attention throughout the whole thing and items were selling as well at the end of the evening as at the beginning. He was
				entertaining and his timing was exquisite so that bids sometimes kept going up even after one thought they were finished. He raised t most money ever - and for a great cause. Thanks, Tony!</blockquote>
			<p>- Marilyn K. Speedie, Ph.D. Dean, University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy</p>
			<hr>
			<p>I am pleased to be able to work from time to time assisting Glen Fladaboe with his benefit auctions. These kind words from Marilyn K. Speedie followed an auction I did for Glen. - Tony</p>

			<blockquote>Many of our guests came back this year because you provided them with a thoroughly entertaining evening [last year]. Your enthusiasm is contagious and everyone had a great time. We are certain that your professionalism, talent, wit,
				and enthusiasm brought more money for the school. Having you as our auctioneer assures us of a successful event.</blockquote>
			<p>- Pat Novacek, Mercy Academy</p>

			<blockquote>You did a fantastic job. Your energy was outstanding and your many creative approaches produced higher bids which made the auction more successful that it has been in the past. You have a very pleasant and enjoyable style and you were
				very entertaining to everyone present. The people who attended have told their friends that this is an event that should not be missed.</blockquote>
			<p>- Laura Hudson, Church of St. Stephen, Anoka, Minnesota</p>

			<blockquote>You helped make this year's event the most profitable one yet. You were able to get the crowd involved and people really enjoyed bidding in the live auction. We made more money from the few items we auctioned off then we did from the
				rest of the fund raising events combined! We heard nothing but positive feedback on you and your employees.</blockquote>
			<p>- Chris Murphy, Woodbury Public Safety Board Liaison</p>

			<blockquote>Tony did an outstanding job and I would strongly recommend him to other organizations. Tony engaged our guests and got them involved in bidding. I heard many positive comments on Tony's ability to keep the crowd involved and to keep
				the auction moving quickly. He made the auction fun! The profits for our live auction this year were much higher than previous years with the use of Tony as our auctioneer.</blockquote>
			<p>- Cheryl Kish, Anoka Technical College Foundation</p>

			<blockquote>Colonel Tony Elfelt is more than an auctioneer&#8212;he is an entertainer. His opening rendition of [LeRoy VanDyke's] "The Auctioneer" captivates the bidders. Then he delves into the auction with an exceptional level of sophistication
				and warmth. Behind the scenes, he is as personable and helpful as he is on stage.</blockquote>
			<p>- Evelyn Gedde, Anoka-Ramsey Community College Campus Foundation-Coon Rapids Campus</p>

			<blockquote>Tony Elfelt was a lively, motivational, and fun auctioneer that really energized the life auction portion of our Children's Surgery International Gala. He really knows how to get the crowd involved and, most importantly, made everyone
				want to participate in the auction.</blockquote>
			<p>- Mary Lufkin Batinich, Children's Surgery International</p>

			<blockquote>Due largely to your auctioneering skill, determination and demeanor, our live auction was a huge success. You did an outstanding job and the auction results exceeded all of our financial expectations.</blockquote>
			<p>- Mike Wock and Larry Morelli, St. Croix Valley Minnesota Deer Hunter's Association</p>
