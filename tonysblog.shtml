        Hello AAA Auction Sellers and Bidders:<br>
        <br>
        The AAA Auction staff, Denise and I would like to thank all of you for
        doing business with us at our location in Ramsey on Highway 10. We are,
        however, leaving this space at the end of February. We remain active in
        the auction business, but until we are able to procure our own building,
        we will focus on auctions at a customer's location or in venues rented
        for a particular auction. <br>
        <br>
        We'll be back at Mau's Corner too for live outdoor auctions on Tuesdays
        as soon as the snow melts. We'll also be adding a Flea Market at Mau's
        before every Tuesday auction.<br>
        <br>
        Thank you once again for your friendship as well as your business over
        the last 10 years. We look forward to many more years of providing you
        with the highest quality and most honest service possible. <br>
        <br>

        had the pleasure of working with Indigo Films in downtown Minneapolis to
        host an auction that they recorded to be the pilot of a new Travel
        Channel show called <i>Auction on Wheels</i>. </big><big style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
        premise of the show is that traveling auctioneer Rod Burnett and his
        ringman Peewee go into a city and pick items to sell. They then bring
        their items to a local auction and sell them. Our crew also sold our
        items for half of the auction, but the show is not about us. We did the
        clerking though, and helped ring for the traveling auctioneer. <br>
      </big><br>
      <big style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">We hope you were
        able to watch the premiere episode on February 5th. Several AAA
        employees and some of our live auction regulars got a little screen
        time. If you missed the show, you can&nbsp;<a href="http://www.travelchannel.com/tv-shows/auction-on-wheels-minneapolis">view
          a short promo of Auction on Wheels</a> on The Travel Channel's web
        site. The AAA Auction employees are the guys wearing the yellow shirts
        at the auction.<br>

        A pawn shop will buy your gun for 35-40% of its value. We will sell it
        for you and pay you 100% of the winning bid! That's right, you pay no
        commission whatsoever when AAA Auction sells your gun. You can even set
        a minimum price so you are protected. So don't wait &#8212; bring your guns,
        ammo and sporting goods to AAA Auction now to be included in our
        February 1st auction of Guns, Ammunition, and Sporting Goods. AAA
        Auction follows all FFL rules.<br>

here
        at AAA Auction are happy to have many friends in the estate sale
        business, and since I am also a lawyer, it was not surprising when one
        of my good estate sale friends contacted me to inquire about the new
        Minnesota Estate Sale law. It seems that there is a concern that the new
        law requires estate sale companies to guarantee that the estate sale
        will bring in $20,000 or make up the difference. This is not true.<br>
        <br>
        The new law merely requires the estate sale company to be bonded to
        provide a source of recovery for the seller or the State of Minnesota
        should the estate sale company not follow its contractual or legal
        obligations.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        So relax, my friends. Get your bond and follow honest and sound business
        practices and you will have no worries about the new law.<br>

      <span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span><big style="font-family: Arial;">Auctions
        at AAA Action and www.auctionmn.com are better than estate sales
        because:<br>
        &nbsp;</big>
      <ul>
        <li><big style="font-family: Arial;">Online estate auctions&nbsp;avoid
            having a person price something so high it doesn't sell or so low it
            sells right away for less money than it is worth.</big></li>
        <li><big style="font-family: Arial;">Competitive bidding means that you
            get top dollar on each item you sell.</big></li>
        <li><big style="font-family: Arial;">There is seldom anything left over
            after an auction.</big></li>
        <li><big style="font-family: Arial;">You don't have hordes of people
            wandering through your house.</big></li>
        <li><big style="font-family: Arial;">More people are exposed to your
            items in our online estate auctions. We have around 50,000 page hits
            per week on our web site alone. That makes us the highest volume
            online seller in Anoka County.</big></li>
        <li><big style="font-family: Arial;">We pay our clients very quickly (in
            about 7-10 days), not in six weeks like most estate sale companies.</big></li>
        <li><big style="font-family: Arial;">We describe each item and often
            include several photographs of each item as well. Most estate sale
            companies take only one photograph of an item and do not describe
            it.</big></li>
        <li><big style="font-family: Arial;">When required, we have certified
            appraisers on our staff who can provide you with well-researched
            opinions on the value of an item.</big></li>
        <li><big style="font-family: Arial;">For higher value items you can
            place a minimum selling price.</big></li>
        <li><big style="font-family: Arial;">At AAA Auction and
            www.auctionmn.com we appreciate your business and will treat you the
            way we would like to be treated if we were a seller or a buyer.</big></li>
      </ul>
      <big style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;Auctionmn.com has around 50,000
        page hits per week so that's a lot of people looking at our web site.
        This volume of traffic will ensure that your items are sold for the
        right price. At an estate sale, if the item is priced too high, it won't
        sell at all and if it's priced too low, you lose money. Our auctions
        usually get the right bids for the true value of the items.<br>

        Auction was chosen to liquidate a huge inventory of new tools from a
        former tool salesman. These tools include everything from large welders
        to small hand tools. We haven't unpacked everything yet, so we don't
        know what all we have to sell. We do have, however, many very large
        tools that require a forklift or at least a dolly to move. Our first
        tool auction will be online only. It will start soon and end on July
        9th. After that, we&nbsp;plan to&nbsp;have a live auction at the AAA
        Auction and Estate Center </big><big style="font-family: Arial;">on
        July 15th,</big><big style="font-family: Arial;">with online pre-bids

        AAA Auction we recommend the method of selling your property that puts
        the most money in your pocket. This could mean that we sell your items
        at the AAA Auction and Estate Center on commission or it might mean we
        come to your house and do an online estate auction or an old-fashioned
        auction. But if you don't have the time for either of these options, AAA
        Auction will also purchase your single items or your whole estate
        outright and move it away for you. If you call us today, your items
        could be gone tomorrow.<br>

      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><big style="font-family: Arial;">All
auctions
        in Minnesota are with "reserve" unless advertised as "absolute." With
        "reserve" means that seller has the right to buy back his own items or
        to bid on them if he thinks the price is too low. However, as stated in
        the terms of our consignment contracts, if a seller buys back his own
        items, he is charged not only the seller's commission, but the buyer's
        premium as well. Therefore we seldom see a seller buying back his own
        items.<br>
        &nbsp;On the other hand, it is illegal for two or more bidders work
        together to keep the price down on items they want to buy. For example,
        if two bidders are both interested in the same two items, it would be
        illegal for them to agree to have each of them bid on just one item and
        not the other. It may be a surprise for some to know that such an
        agreement is actually a felony. The Sherman Act calls this "restraint of
        trade" and declares such activity to be a felony. That's why you may
        have heard it said that: "There are no friends at an auction." </big><big style="font-family: Arial;"><br>

          auctionmn.com for all the great auctions we have online and we are
          grateful that you do that. I would like to take a moment though to let
          you know that I also provide fund-raising auction services. As a
          matter of fact,&nbsp;I was the first auctioneer in Minnesota to earn
          the designation "BAS" from the National Auctioneer's Association as a
          Certified Benefit Auction Specialist. </font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          In the last several years I have helped raise millions of dollars for
          many diverse non-profits. I accomplish that with a high energy, fun,
          and sometimes emotionally powerful auction style. Please <a href="http://www.auctionmn.com/video1.shtml" target="_blank">watch my Benefit Auction video</a> if you would like
          to see a short sample of what I can do.<br>
          &nbsp;So, if your church, school, or other non-profit needs an
          auctioneer, please ask them to call me at (763) 421-2099 and mention
          your name. If your organization hires me and lets me know that you
          referred me, I will be happy to pay you $150 and also make a personal
          contribution to your organization of $100. Thank you. <br>

            25th with Online Prebidding<br>
            February 21, 2012</b><br>
          &nbsp;Hello Bidders,<br>
          &nbsp;We now have a firm date for the 24-vault auction at AAA Movers
          in Crystal. It will be on Sunday, March 25th starting at noon. We will
          post photos online and allow prebidding on <a href="http://www.auctionmn.com/">www.auctionmn.com</a>
          about 10 days prior.&nbsp;Prebidding will end at 9 a.m. on March 25th,
          the day of the live auction. Live bidding will start where the prebids
          leave off. We will place bids for any prebidder who also places a
          maximum bid online.&nbsp;Please note that we are not selling the
          wooden vaults themselves or any packing materials or shipping blankets
          that may be in the vaults. &nbsp;There will be no pre-auction preview.
          There will be an opportunity to look into the vaults immediatley
          before the bidding begins on each vault. The vaults are 5' x 7' x 7'.
          We will remove one door from one end of each vault, but everyone will
          be required to stand back several feet from the vaults. Nothing can be
          unloaded or touched. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Payment for the vaults must be in cash or by credit card. Winners will
          be allowed to have access to their purchases after the live auction is
          over, (which we expect to be around 1:30 p.m.) but not before. Winners
          must remove their purchases immediately after the live auction ends.
          Pickup for the online winners will be from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. after the
          live auction ends on Sunday, March 25th.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Are you as excited as we are? See you there!<br>

          <b>February 10, 2012</b><br>
          &nbsp;Hello Bidders,<br>
          &nbsp;Many of you know that I am also a lawyer. My law office is on
          Main Street across from the Anoka Government Center where I work with
          Bill Erhart in our law firm called Erhart and Elfelt, LLC. For over 30
          years, my law practice has involved protecting the rights of injured
          people. This has mainly focused on making sure my clients' bills get
          paid and that they are fairly compensated for injuries caused by other
          people. I have handled thousands of cases ranging from neck and back
          pain to broken bones, paralysis and death. There is no charge to talk
          with me, so if you or someone you know could use some good legal
          advice, please call me at (763) 444-4444.<br>
          &nbsp;Also, many people who come to the AAA Auction and Estate Center
          are there because the responsibility of handling a deceased person's
          estate has fallen to them. When that happens, there are often other
          legal concerns that go beyond selling the personal property. When that
          happens, I refer those people to my partner, Bill Erhart. Bill has
          over 33 years of experience assisting people with drawing up their
          wills and handling probate matters. He is thorough, smart and tough
          when it&#8217;s required and you can also reach him at (763) 444-4444. If
          you mention that you saw this note, you will receive a free 1/2 hour
          estate planning consultation. <br>
          Bill and I will post updates regarding interesting developments in
          personal injury and estate planning law to our "<a href="http://www.auctionmn.com/legaltidbits.shtml">Legal
            Tidbits</a>" page, which you can display by clicking on the Legal
          Tidbits button in the menu on the left side of our home page:<br>
          &nbsp;Thank you,<br>

        Saturday for our Live/Online Proxibid auction. For those of you who
        logged in and listened to the auction, I hope you had a good experience.
        We had bidders from 25 states and we'll be busy shipping items for a
        while. We also recognize that some folks had trouble using the Proxibid
        web site,&nbsp;so many of you will be happy to hear that the next
        auction we will be putting up from this large collectible estate will be
        right here on this very web site. We have plenty more to sell and
        there's still more for us to bring&nbsp;to the AAA Auction and Estate
        Center. <br>

          &nbsp;As you know, we have been honored with the opportunity to sell a
          very large collectible estate. The auction that closed on January 23rd
          is the first full auction of these unique collectibles. Our next
          auction for this estate, which will be posted very soon, will be on <a href="http://www.proxibid.com/">www.proxibid.com</a>. <br>
          You will still be able to review the photos and descriptions for this
          auction on our own web site as usual, but there will be no bidding
          boxes there. In order to bid, you will need to register at and log on
          to <a href="http://www.proxibid.com/">www.proxibid.com</a>. If you
          are unfamiliar with Proxibid, you can go to their web site and watch
          some of the auctions that are always taking place. When the auction is
          ready, we will post a link on our home page, and send out an e-mail to
          those of you who have an auctionmn.com bidder number. <br>
          Many of you will recall the <a href="http://www.proxibid.com/asp/Catalog.asp?aid=41550" target="_blank">Proxibid auction that we held last August</a> at our
          former location in Anoka.&nbsp;This new auction will be just like that
          one except we will, unfortunately, not have any in-person bidding at
          the AAA Auction and Estate Center. The auction will run for several
          days, and you can put in a maximum bid so the system will bid on your
          behalf whether or not you are logged in. The auction close will be a
          little different. We will be doing a &#8220;live close&#8221; instead of a &#8220;timed
          close.&#8221; You will have the opportunity to listen to a live auction
          chant on you computer and to bid online in real time for each of the
          items as they come up for auction. <br>
          Winning bidders may pick up their items at the AAA Auction and Estate
          Center, or they may choose to have them shipped. Details will be in
          the auction listing. <br>

      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Hello Bidders,<br>
          &nbsp;Denise and I would like to thank all of the many people bidding
          on auctionmn.com. As you know, our auction family is growing rapidly.
          While we are very appreciative of our growth, the volume of items that
          we have been selling has presented some challenges. One of those is
          late pickups which create added cost in staff time, and a delay in
          processing our next auction. They also unfairly delay the consignor
          from receiving payment for his items. Also, since our space is
          limited,&nbsp;storing&nbsp;the late pickups also creates a space
          issue. So, we would like to thank all of our bidders who pick up their
          items at the scheduled time and we ask everyone else to try to do the
          same. &nbsp; <br>
          The late pickup situation has required us to implement these new
          procedures as of the January 18th pickup:<br>
          &nbsp;</font></big>
      <ol>
        <li><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Starting with our
              auction ending on January 16th, we will add to our regular
              Wednesday pickup a Thursday pickup opportunity from 9 am until
              noon.</font></big></li>
        <li><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">We will start
              charging $10.00 for any late pickup.&nbsp;</font></big></li>
        <li><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">For late pickups and
              for those bidders who registered with a credit card, there will be
              a $10 late fee charged to the bidder's credit card.&nbsp;</font></big></li>
        <li><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">For those bidders who
              did not register with a credit card, their bidding privileges will
              be suspended until they pay for their items along with the late
              fee, and add their credit card information to their bidder
              profile.</font></big></li>
      </ol>

          I hope everyone had a safe and happy New Year's celebration. I know we
          did. The fish were really biting until the wind blew us off the lake.
          That's was OK though because Denise and I were anxious to go home and
          get busy putting up the first items from the 40-plus-year collection
          we promised you. Some pieces will go up this weekend for our auction
          closing on January 16th. Our Auction and Estate Center is full now,
          and we are going back for more soon. If you like kitchen collectibles,
          Griswold items, toys from the 30's and 40's, clocks, vintage
          needlepoint,&nbsp;glassware, antiques and the like, you will want to
          stay tuned.<br>

            Reminders</font></font></b><br>
      <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Here are some brief reminders
          about how to place bids. <br>
          <i><b><font color="#000099">Two "Submit Bids" Buttons</font></b></i><br>
          After you click the "Submit Bids" button, the computer will summarize
          your bids for you and show a new&nbsp;"Submit Bids" button, which you
          must also click for your bids to be processed.&nbsp;After your bid has
          been successfully submitted, you will see a screen that shows whether
          you are now the high bidder or whether someone else has previously
          placed a higher maximum bid.<br>
          &nbsp;</font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><i><b><font color="#000099">"Outbid" E-mails and "Outbid" Red Triangles<br>
              </font></b></i></font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">If
          you are the high bidder and you get outbid at a later time, you will
          receive an e-mail notifying you of that. However, if the auction is
          already in the process of closing, you will not receive an e-mail. </font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">If you are logged in, a red
          triangle will appear next to those lots on which you have been outbid.
          You can log in by placing another bid, or by entering your bidder
          number and password at the bottom of a page with bidding boxes, then
          clicking the "Review Bids" button. That button limits the list of lots
          to display only those lots that you have bid on. </font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
        </font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><i><b><font color="#000099">Refresh Often</font></b></i></font></big><br>
      <big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">After the auction starts to
          close, it is important to frequently refresh your browser to show
          up-to-date bids. When the auction is closing, there will be a
          "Refresh" link next to each lot's listing. Each of those links will
          refresh the entire page. You can also use your browser's refresh or
          reload option. If you do not refresh, your screen will show outdated
          information, and you may be surprised to find out later that someone
          else was the high bidder on your lot.<br>
          &nbsp;</font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><i><b><font color="#000099">Closing Time Extensions</font></b></i></font></big><br>
      <big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Any bid placed within three
          minutes of the closing time for a lot will&nbsp;</font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">extend&nbsp;the bidding time (</font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">delay the closing time</font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">) for that lot. </font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Due to the way our system records
          bids, the actual extended time will be between two and three minutes.
          Each new bid during the extended bidding time will further extend the
          bidding time,&nbsp;until no bids are received during the last time
          extension.</font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          &nbsp;</font></big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><i><b><font color="#000099">"Your Maximum" Bidding Box</font></b></i></font></big><br>

          charges us a fee when folks pay with a credit card and we have been
          charging an extra 5% buyer's premium to cover those fees. From now on
          though, we will charge a credit card convenience fee of only 3%. On
          the other hand, we have found it necessary to raise the buyer's
          premium to 13%. While some companies still charge a 10% buyer's
          premium, when we did a survey, we found that buyer's premiums of more
          than 10% are not uncommon with some companies charging 15% and even
          16.785%. We hope that you will continue to agree that the quality of
          our service is well worth the fees we charge. Thank you.<br>

      <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><font size="3"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">We will consider your
          special needs when making a recommendation for the best way to hold
          your sale. For some the best approach might be a live auction. For
          others it might be a traditional estate sale. But for many people an
          online estate auction brings in the most money with the least risk and
          hassle.<br>
          &nbsp;Here is how we do it:<br>
          &nbsp;A trained appraiser or auctioneer goes to your home and meets
          with you. If it turns out that we recommend an online estate auction
          and if that is what you choose, a date will then be set up for our
          staff of usually two or three people to return to your home to take
          pictures of everything to be sold. They will also put a numbered
          sticker on each item and type a description of that item into our
          computer.<br>
          &nbsp;Once all the photos are taken and descriptions written, we will
          turn the data over to our webmaster, who will make every photograph
          look fantastic, and put the auction on the Internet for the world to
          see. We then return to your home again for a "preview day&#8221; which is a
          time when people can come to the home and inspect the items to be
          sold. After the auction closes at a predetermined date and time, we
          send all winning bidders an invoice by e-mail. We will then come back
          to your home two days later to collect the money from the buyers and
          to give them their purchases. Finally, in 7-10 days after the auction
          we will send you your check and a computerized printout of everything
          that sold.<br>
          <br>
          An online estate auction is often better than a live estate sale
          because:</font></font>&nbsp;
      <ul>
        <li><font size="3"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The seller is
              not subject to leaving money on the table in case the traditional
              estate sale host prices something too low or too high. If the item
              is priced too low, it will obviously sell for below market value.
              If it is priced too high, it obviously won't sell at all. Then on
              the second day of the live estate sale when most everything is
              marked down 50%, the item may sell, but for less than what it is
              worth. For example, assume an item is worth $200, but on the first
              day of the sale, it is priced at $300. No one will buy it. Then on
              the second day when prices are routinely dropped by 50%, the item
              will be marked down to $150. Naturally, it will then sell, but the
              owner will have lost the $50 between the item's $200 real value
              and the selling price of $150. However, if the item were sold in
              an online auction, the market will drive the price up to where it
              should be and it will likely sell at or above the $200 value.<br>
              &nbsp;</font></font></li>
        <li><font size="3"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Another
              reason an online estate auction is often better than a traditional
              estate sale is because many things are often left over after a
              traditional estate sale. After an online auction however, almost
              everything gets sold and goes away. That is because the lower
              value items are sold in groups or lots at an online estate
              auction. For example, instead of selling screwdrivers out of a box
              for 50 cents each and having 50 of them left over, we will sell
              the whole box to an online bidder. We will also sell flats or
              boxes of items that will include some less desirable items with
              the more desirable items.<br>
              &nbsp;</font></font></li>
        <li><font size="3"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">A traditional
              estate sale often has 100 or more people lined up outside the
              seller's door waiting for the start of the estate sale. Although
              they are not all allowed in at once, when the first 20 or so are
              allowed in, there is usually a mad rush all over the house. Items
              can be broken and carpets can be soiled. Items can also find their
              way into pockets where they do not belong. An online estate
              auction, however, is orderly. Since people cannot buy the item in
              person, there is no rush. Also, since most of the buyers will rely
              on the photographs and descriptions they see online, throngs of
              people don't go through the seller's house at all.<br>
              &nbsp;</font></font></li>
        <li><font size="3"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Like it or
              not, people like to buy online. It&#8217;s easy. It&#8217;s convenient and
              it&#8217;s fun. Online bidders also don't have to get up at four a.m. to
              get a number to be first in line at the estate sale in order to
              get the best deals. Everyone has an equal chance to bid and that
              means more bids and money for the seller.</font></font></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="3"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Whereas some
              tradtional estate companies take up to six weeks to pay you the
              proceeds of your sale, we pay you within 7-10 days.<br>
              &nbsp;</font></font></li>
      </ul>
      <font size="3"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">So, while there is
          certainly a place for traditional auctions and traditional estate
          sales, in many cases you can get more money with less risk and less
          hassle when your sale is conducted as an online auction.</font></font><br>

though

          This only applies to motor boats. AAA Auction encourage sellers of

          in. You can also put a reserve or minimum price on your boat or motor.
          So, if you have a boat or motor to sell, call us today to reserve your
          spot: (763) 421-2099.<br>
          &nbsp;And for those of you who prefer muscle-powered watercraft, AAA
          Auction is pleased to announce that we have again been chosen to

          Everyone! <br>
          Thank you to all who attended our live auction on Saturday. It was
          very nice to see not only many of our old friends, but also a lot of
          new faces as well.<br>
          Sunday was a busy day for us at the AAA Auction and Estate Center. We
          unloaded the next load of unclaimed freight and then Denise and I
          visited with a charming couple who are downsizing in Coon Rapids and
          who will be having us do an antique and collectible online auction at
          their home. They have many very nice things, so if you like antiques
          and collectibles, you'll want to watch for this one. So long for now.

                  weekend, it&#8217;s because the Minnesota State Auctioneers'
                  Convention was being held in St. Cloud and most of the state's
                  serious and dedicated auctioneers attended. Members of the
                  association agree to conduct their businesses according to a
                  code of conduct that recognizes both legal obligations and
                  also ethical obligations to our sellers and buyers. Members
                  usually display the MSAA logo in their ads too, and by doing
                  business with a member of this group, you can be assured of
                  having a fine and honest auctioneer working for you. Years ago
                  we used to hear, "This product has the Good Housekeeping Seal
                  of Approval." When it comes to auctions, look for the MSAA

          everyone! I hope you all had a safe and enjoyable holiday. For my
          part, we welcomed in the New Year with a karaoke party up at the AAA
          Auction and Estate Center. All I have to say about that is that it was
          a good thing the rest of the shopping center was closed when we were
          singing. <br>
          We have now posted the first auction with unclaimed freight together
          with a couple estates. We have interesting things from all sources
          that you don't often see at auctions.<br>
          &nbsp;Also, although we already have a lot of good inventory for our
          January 15th live auction at the AAA Auction and Estate Center, we
          always have room to add additional quality consignments. So if you
          received a Christmas gift that you can't return but won't use, how
          about bringing it up to the AAA Auction and Estate Center?&nbsp;Please
          call us first though at (763) 421-3044.<br>

      <font size="3"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Hello Everyone,<br>
          &nbsp;Thank you to all who visited us at the Anoka Auction and Estate
          Center for the recent indoor estate sale conducted by our good friend,
          Maggi, from Gently Kept Estate Sales. We heard many nice comments like
          how nice it was not to have to go up and down stairs in someone's
          house and how comfortable it was to have all the elbow room the Anoka
          Auction and Estate Center offers.<br>
          &nbsp;Thanks also to all who bid on items in our Asian auction and in
          our consignment auction that closed on Monday, December 20th. We are
          very grateful for your bids.<br>
          &nbsp;We are just now starting to open up all the boxes of unclaimed
          freight we recently received in a large semi trailer. Although we are
          just starting, it looks like we are going to have a large assortment
          of items including a whole pallet of John Deere parts. Most of this
          will be put on another online auction shortly. <br>
          Do you need a great car? Our next online auction will have a 1985
          Cadillac Cimarron with only 40,080 miles on it.<br>
          &nbsp;We also will be holding another live auction at the AAA Auction
          and Estate Center soon. Please join us as a buyer or a seller, or
          better yet, as both. <br>
          All of us at AAA Auction and Realty and auctionmn.com would like to
          wish everyone a happy and joyous Christmas season. <br>

            conduct a liquidation of the Oriental Furniture &amp; Home
            Decorations store in St. Paul. So if you have not already <a href="http://www.auctionmn.com/cgi-bin/mdemail.cgi?auctionmn">joined
our
              e-mail list</a>, you should do that now so you will be informed
            when the first of at least two Oriental and Asian Decor online
            auctions will take place. For sure we will have one before
            Christmas, so you can plan on shopping with us. Thank you.<br>

            &nbsp;</b><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Hi Folks,<br>
            &nbsp;Hunting season is right around the corner. There is no better
            time to sell that old gun that's been under your bed for the last
            several years. There's also no better way to sell than online with
            auctionmn.com, where we have a full federal firearms license. You
            can also protect your gun with a reserve to make sure it doesn't
            sell too low. Hunting gear also sells well, so think of us when you
            get around to cleaning out the garage. We plan to dedicate an entire
            auction to guns and hunting this fall. Good items to sell are of
            course guns, but also ammunition, decoys, bows and arrows, stands,
            ATV's, boats, camouflage clothing, knives and the like.<br>

      <p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">What a fun time Denise and I are having with our friends
            Carl and Eileen at the World&#8217;s Longest Yard Sale. We left Minnesota
            last Sunday and made our way to Gadsden Alabama, the southernmost
            tip of the sale. It wasn't scheduled to start until Thursday, but we
            found some friendly folks and helped them unload their truck as they
            were setting up their booth. We bought some good items from them.<br>
            &nbsp;We are pulling an 18' trailer. Our plan was to fill up the
            trailer with cool stuff to sell online at auctionmn.com.
            Unfortunately, we ran out of money before we ran out of space.
            Yesterday we were looking for sales. Today we are looking for an
            ATM.<br>
            &nbsp;It was great fun stopping and haggling with the locals,
            especially in Tennessee. We met many good old boys and everyone we
            encountered was very friendly, except the yahoo who shot a bullet
            through our trailer at some point. We don't know when that happened,
            but I'm sure they were shooting at Carl for slamming on the brakes
            to stop at a sale.<br>
            &nbsp;We really did find some good stuff. Carl is the pedal car
            expert and I found some Hopalong Cassidy items.<br>
            &nbsp;From there we traveled north for a little slice of Georgia and
            into Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and then Indiana. There wasn't time
            to go all the way to the northern end of the sale, so we left the
            Highway 127 yard sale corridor and are heading northwest to Galena,
            Illinois. </font></font><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></font></font></p>

            &nbsp;If you are a seller, now is the time to <a href="http://www.auctionmn.com/consignment_info.shtml" target="_blank">consign your items</a>. As we get up and running
            we are offering sellers&#8217; commissions as low as 5% or even FREE!
            Those rates won't last very long though, so if you have something to
            sell, this is a great time to bring it in. We don't take everything
            though. We are trying to limit our auctions to higher-quality
            merchandise. So we generally don't take garage sale leftovers or
            items that have little or no resale value. We are always happy to
            answer your questions about what may or may not be worth bringing in
            to the AAA Auction and Estate Center.<br>
            &nbsp;We also conduct auctions on site at your location and we pay
            generous amounts for estates we purchase outright. We can arrange to
            come to your home to transport your items to the AAA Auction and
            Estate Center in Anoka as well. Thank you.<br>

            Midwest Mountaineering Spring Expo and Online Update</b></font></p>
      <font size="3"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">What a fun day we
          had Saturday at Midwest Mountaineering&#8217;s 50th Annual Spring Expo! We
          had over 100 canoes and kayaks to sell and the sellers and buyers came
          out in spite of the rainy weather. Fortunately we had the weather
          forecast, so we had time to put up canopies before the rain came.
          Although our online auctions are going great, I still love getting up
          and calling out bids to a live crowd -- even when my generator quits
          running and I have no loudspeakers. I guess it helps to be a loud
          mouth to begin with. Also, for those of you who went to the AAA
          Auction and Estate Center by mistake on Saturday, I apologize. The
          announcement that we sent out a couple months ago could have been
          clearer.<br>
          &nbsp;AAA Auction also has now completed its 8th&nbsp;online auction.
          The most recent one was a large and very nice estate in Edina. We were
          very happy to have been asked to team up with Gently Kept Estate Sales
          for this online auction. Everything stayed right there in Edina rather
          than coming to the AAA Auction and Estate Center in Anoka. On-site
          online auctions are a great alternative to a traditional estate sale
          or a live auction. They usually make more money for the seller and
          just about everything seems to get sold. They are also a lot of fun to
          watch on the computer as the bids often come rushing in towards the
          end of the auction. We set up our online auctions to be fair to
          everyone. If an item receives a bid within three minutes of its
          scheduled closing time, the bidding for that item is automatically
          extended for three minutes from the time of that bid. Those time
          extensions continue until there are no additional bids for three
          minutes. Last night we had one item that was extended about ten times
          because there was so much competition for the item. <br>
          Of course, sometimes an old fashioned live auction is the best choice
          for the seller. So, one of the most important things we do is consider
          the seller's needs and then make a recommendation that fits our seller
          best.<br>
          &nbsp;See you at the auction!<br>

          August, 2009. This has been a very convenient and comfortable way to
          conduct auctions. No worries about the weather and no rush to set
          everything up during the 12 hours before an auction.<br>
          &nbsp;Our benefit auction business has been expanding as well.
          Although times are tough, we have found that generosity still abounds.
          For example, we recently sold an autographed Adrian Peterson jersey
          for nearly $4,000! I am told that one of the things that make our
          benefit business unique is that we bring trained ringmen to assist in
          the bidding. In my opinion, this is essential to a great benefit
          because the ringmen not only help persuade folks to bid, but they help
          make the auction a show as well as a sale.<br>

            Simpson Auction</b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">It was AUCTION TIME again last Sunday in Andover. Little
            did we know when we scheduled the auction in August that we would
            have 50-mile-an-hour wind gusts, temperatures in the low 30s and
            snow. Even so, well over 100 bidders attended the Bob Simpson
            auction and had great buys on collectible farm toys, Elvis
            memorabilia, tools, guns, and more. Our food vendors kept everyone
            warm with hot food and our tents kept everyone out of the
            wind&nbsp;most of the time. On behalf of our clients and AAA
            Auction, thank you very much for attending, and we'll see you at the
            next AUCTION!&nbsp;</font></font></p>

      <p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4"><b>April 28, 2008<br>
            Benefit Auctions</b> </font></p>
      <font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Benefit Auctions are an exciting and fun way to raise money
          for charitable organizations. From smaller groups such as chapters of
          Ducks Unlimited to large organizations such as the Heart Fund and
          major hospitals, everyone at the auction can have fun while achieving
          worthwhile goals. Galas and fundraisers are quite a bit different
          though from the typical auctions. For example, at a Benefit Auction,
          the auctioneer usually sells 10 to 20 items whereas at an estate or
          antique auction, the auctioneer will sell hundreds of items at one
          auction.<br>
          &nbsp;But, what the benefit auctioneer lacks in quantity, he makes up
          for in money raised and entertainment provided. In fact, the best
          benefit auctioneers think of themselves as much as entertainers as
          they do auctioneers. Since only about 5% of the gala guests bid at
          live auctions, the auctioneer needs to make the auction fun and
          entertaining for the other 95% of the people too. The 95% who don't
          bid need to have fun too so they spread the word about how enjoyable
          the event was and also so they come back next year ready to spend
          money. Not only have I been able to break many records regarding the
          amount of money raised at live auctions, but many folks have mentioned
          to me how much they have enjoyed the humor, the excitement, and even
          the occasional song that I use at the events where I perform.<br>
          &nbsp;As one of the first Certified Benefit Auction Specialists in
          Minnesota, I am available to counsel your group about all phases of
          the Benefit, or I am available to simply conduct the live auction for
          you. As always, I am available for unlimited phone conferences and
          e-mails from all of my clients.<br>
