	  		<h1>Mau's Corner Bidding Information</h1>

	  		<ol>
	  			<li>Everything is for sale today is “AS-IS” “WHERE-IS”. There are no guarantees or warranties of any kind. When the auctioneer says “Sold,” the high bidder becomes the new owner of the item.</li>
	  			<li>Inspect items before bidding and protect them after you buy them.</li>
	  			<li>Do not move items from one box or one table to another.</li>
	  			<li>We charge a 15% Buyer’s Premium plus sales tax. That is an amount added to your bill to help pay for the costs of the auction.</li>
	  			<li>We accept all major credit cards except American Express. We will add a 3% fee if a credit card is used.</li>
	  			<li>We do not take out-of-state checks.</li>
	  			<li>Permanent bidders must check in at the Courtesy Desk.</li>
	  			<li>New bidders must obtain a bidding number at the Courtesy Desk.</li>
	  			<li>Rain cancellations will be posted on our website at www.auctionmn.com.</li>
	  			<li>Food is sold in the garage.</li>
	  			<li>The bathroom is behind the storage building.</li>
	  			<li>If you buy your own item, you will be charged the regular commission PLUS the 15% Buyer’s Premium, but no sales tax.</li>
	  			<li>When you win an item, please come forward and remove it from the table.</li>
	  			<li>Have your bidder number handy to show the auctioneer when you win.</li>
	  			<li>If you cannot take you item with you on the day of the auction, please let the staff know when you will be returning to pick it up and leave a note on the item with your name and bidder number so no one else picks it up by mistake. Any item left on the premises after the auction without letting us know and without it being marked will be considered abandoned.</li>
	  			<li>We reserve the right to ask for a credit card to guarantee large checks.</li>
	  			<li>Anyone caught stealing will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</li>
	  			<li>Titled vehicles and coins must be paid for in cash.</li>
