	  		<h1>Mau's Corner Bidding Information</h1>

	  		<ol>
	  			<li>Everything is for sale today is “AS-IS” “WHERE-IS”.  There are no guarantees or warranties of any kind. When the auctioneer says “Sold,” the item becomes yours.</li>

	  			<li>Do not move items from one box or one table to another.</li>
	  			<li>Except for firearms and coins (U.S. currency) we charge a 15% Buyer’s Premium plus sales tax. That is an amount added to your bill to help pay for the costs of the auction. A Buyer’s Premium of 10% will be charged for firearms and coins</li>
	  			<li>We accept all major credit cards. We will add a 3% fee if a credit card is used.</li>

	  			<li>If you cannot take you item with you on the day of the auction, please let the staff know when you will be returning to pick it up and leave a note on the item with your name and bidder number so no one else picks it up by mistake.
