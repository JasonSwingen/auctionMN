<b>Denise Elfelt</b>
<br>
Denise is co-owner of AAA Auction. She runs our online auction business at our
Auction Center in Ramsey and also clerks our sales during our live
auctions.&nbsp; She is so friendly, we think some people buy from
us
just to come in and visit with her. She is a professional personal
property appraiser, having completed both the National Auctioneers
Association's training as a G.P.P.A., and also the Continental School
of Auctioneering's certification program as a C.P.P.A. Denise is
married to Tony, and when she's not working for AAA Auction, she is
most likely visiting with her four grandchildren. </td>

John is a highly skilled auctioneer and one of the nicest guys in
the business. Not only does he do a great job calling auctions, but he
also is the guy who keeps our computers running. When John is not
calling an auction, he drives a truck for Lakeville Motor Express,
where he has been employed since 1987.&nbsp; </td>

Masloski</b><br>
Dan
is an auctioneer and one of the best benefit auction ringmen around. At
benefit galas and auctions, Dan&nbsp; makes sure that no one leaves
the
event without having every opportunity to spend or pledge money to the
cause. Not only a great auctioneer, Dan is fun and entertaining. When
Dan is not helping AAA Auction raise money for charities, he manages
the Park Department for the City of Champlin, Minnesota.</td>

Paige<br>
</b>Carl
has more auctions under his belt than all of us put together. As a
former antique dealer, he has a vast knowledge of antiques and
collectibles. Also, as a former mechanic, he is our go-to guy to
identify and describe many of the unusual tools and pieces of equipment
that come our way. Carl is a U.S. Navy veteran and a valuable member of
our team.</td>

Elfelt</b>
<br>
Larry keeps our live auctions moving fast. He's the guy who hollers
"YES!" when you bid or hollers "Let's Go!" if he thinks the auctioneer
too slow. We also rely on Larry to help set up auctions. Larry is
married to Corinne, and when he is not working for AAA Auction or
attending an auction elsewhere, you can find Larry delivering mail in
Anoka or putting out fires in Andover.&nbsp;</td>

snaps into action when we need muscle to go out and pick up an estate
to bring to the Auction Center. He also is a picker on pickup days when
our buyers come in to get their purchases. Paul also does a lot of our
shipping. When Paul is not working for AAA Auction, he will most likely
be buying at someone else's auction.</td>
