<h1>Selling Tips</h1>

<p>Often sellers do not know the best way for them to sell their items. When that happens we are happy to review with you, your needs and your items and make a recommendation. We often begin by asking you to send us photographs. This can sometimes determine whether an in-person visit would be helpful.</p>

<p>As a general rule, if you sell good items, you will get good prices. If you sell junk, you will get bad prices.</p>

<p>We recommend that you group your small items in lots that will sell for at least $10. If you do not do that, we will try to group your items to get a bid of at least $5. If we cannot get a bid for $5, we will sell your items for whatever we can get.</p>

<p>See the table below for examples of good and not-so-good consignment items.</p>

<p>Please make sure that your items are clean and have no price stickers or price tags on them.</p>

<p>If you think that there is information about a particular item that would be helpful to the buyer, please write the information on a piece of paper and tape it to your item.</p>

<p>Although everything is sold as-is at an auction, we try to be as upfront about the items we are selling. So if you have an item that does not work, please leave a note on it that provides the buyer with information that fairly describes the condition.</p>

<p>If you bring us an item with a value over $300, you may place a reserve on that item. This is your minimum selling price. Your item will not sell if that price is not met. We charge a $20 fee if your item does not meet the reserve.</p>

<p>Large value items can be included in the advertising done by AAA Auction provided the Seller gives AAA Auction sufficient notice.</p>

<p>If a seller buys his own item back, he is required to pay for it in the same manner as would anyone else.</p>

<p>We are often asked what good items to sell are. The following are examples of items that seem to sell well and others that do not.</p>
