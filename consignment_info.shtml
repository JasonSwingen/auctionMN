<h1>Consigning Items</h1>
<p>People bring items to us, or we go get everything from
individual
items to truckloads to whole estates. We then sell those items in an
online auction or at a live auction. Most of our sellers let us decide
how to sell their items, but we are happy to follow your directions if
you prefer one type of auction over the other.<br>
<br>
Items are sold individually or in groups. Each item or group of items
is called a "lot." You may group your items into lots, or you may
choose to have us do that for you. Anyone can sell at these
auctions. Please call us at (763) 421-3044 to learn about our new low
commission rates. We also offer special rates for entire estates. We do
not charge a seller's commission for selling guns.<br>
<br>
You can drop off items just about any time, but it is best to call
(763) 421-3044 first to make sure we are there and that we have room
for your items. Please bring your own manpower to unload your items and
bring them into our building. We will take over from that point.<br>
<br>
Please make sure that your items are clean and have no price stickers
or price tags on them. We will reject items that we do not think will
be of interest to our buyers. For example, we do not accept doors,
windows, appliances, or TVs (unless they have a built-in HDTV tuner).
Please don't bring us items that did not sell at a garage sale. Those
items probably would not sell at an auction either. If any of your
items do not sell, AAA Auction will send you an e-mail or call you and
you will have 48 hours to come and pick up the unsold items. Any items
remaining at the Auction Center after 48 hours will be disposed of. See
the table below for examples of <a href="consignment_info2.shtml#consignment_items">good
and
not-so-good consignment items</a>. If you have any questions
about what we accept, we would be happy to speak with you.<br>
<br>
If you bring us an item with a value of over $300, you may place a
reserve on that item. This is your minimum selling price that you would
accept. Your item will not sell if that price isn't met. There is a
small fee if your item does not sell.<br><br>
We also purchase estates and single items, so if you prefer to sell
your items right away, we would be happy to meet with you to consider
purchasing your items directly.<br>

These items generally do not do well and we will likely
not accept them. If you do see any of these at our
auctions, it is probably because we have agreed to do
an entire estate auction and sell everything for our
