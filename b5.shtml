		<img title="Live auctions at Mau's Corner" src="http://www.auctionmn.com/images/news/mau.jpg" alt="Live auctions at Mau's Corner"> Here's a question......What does your garage look like? How about your shed, barn, or basement? It's time to start getting ready for Tuesday Auctions and Flea Markets at Mau's Corner, three miles north of St. Francis on Highway 47. Our next auction and flea market at Mau's Corner is on Tuesday, July 15th. Cancellations due to weather will be listed on our <a href="http://www.auctionmn.com">home page</a>.<br>
		<br>
		Do you have too much to bring to us? How about an auction or estate sale at your location? We'd love to hear from you!<br>

		<br>
		The AAA Auction staff, Denise and I would like to thank all of you for doing business with us at our location in Ramsey on Highway 10. We are, however, leaving this space at the end of February. We remain active in the auction business, but until we are able to procure our own building, we will focus on auctions at a customer's location or in venues rented for a particular auction.<br>
		<br>
		We'll be back at Mau's Corner too for live outdoor auctions on Tuesdays as soon as the snow melts. We'll also be adding a Flea Market at Mau's before every Tuesday auction.<br>
		<br>
		Thank you once again for your friendship as well as your business over the last 10 years. We look forward to many more years of providing you with the highest quality and most honest service possible.<br>

		<strong>Vintage Toys and Old Stuff Auction</strong><br>
		Saturday, February 15, 2014 at 10 a.m. CST at the AAA Auction Center<br>
		<br>

		The day after our <a href="http://www.auctionmn.com/#2014-02-14">live auction in Medina</a>, we'll be back at the AAA Auction Center in Ramsey for another live auction. In addition to toys, we will be selling radios, banks, clocks, cameras, coins, trains, and lots of other cool stuff. About half of the lots are <a href="http://www.auctionmn.com/cgi-bin/mndetails.cgi?auctionmn4">available now for online pre-bidding</a>, and 200 or more items will be sold live that are not online.<br>
		Never been to a live auction? Come on -- It's fun!<br>

		<strong>Auction on Wheels Cable TV Show First Episode</strong><br>
		<br>
		Hello Our Auction Friends,<br>
		<br>
		<a href="http://www.auctionmn.com/tonysblog.shtml#2014-02-05"><img src="http://www.auctionmn.com/images/news/auction_on_wheels.jpg" title="Auction News" alt="Auction News" align="left"; margin:0px 6px; border="0" ></a>Last June, AAA Auction had the pleasure of working with Indigo Films in downtown Minneapolis to host an auction that they recorded to be the pilot of a new Travel Channel show called Auction on Wheels. The premise of the show is that traveling auctioneer Rod Burnett and his ringman Peewee go into a city and pick items to sell. They then bring their items to a local auction and sell them. Our crew also sold our items for half of the auction, but the show is not about us. We did the clerking though, and helped ring for the traveling auctioneer.<br>
		<br>
		We hope you were able to watch the premiere episode on February 5th. Several AAA employees and some of our live auction regulars got a little screen time. If you missed the show, you can <a href="http://www.travelchannel.com/tv-shows/auction-on-wheels-minneapolis">view a short promo of Auction on Wheels</a> on The Travel Channel's web site. The AAA Auction employees are the guys wearing the yellow shirts at the auction.<br>
		<br>
		Thanks for watching.<br>

		A pawn shop will buy your gun for 35-40% of its value. We will sell it for you and pay you 100% of the winning bid! That's right, you pay no commission whatsoever when AAA Auction sells your gun. You can even set a minimum price so you are protected. So don't wait -- bring your guns, ammo and sporting goods to AAA Auction now to be included in our February 1st auction of Guns, Ammunition, and Sporting Goods. AAA Auction follows all FFL rules.<br>

		New Estate Sale Law in Minnesota</strong><br>
		<br>
		<img src="http://www.auctionmn.com/images/news/newlaw.jpg" title="Happy New Year!" alt="Happy New Year!" >We here at AAA Auction are happy to have many friends in the estate sale business, and since I am also a lawyer, it was not surprising when one of my good estate sale friends contacted me to inquire about the new Minnesota Estate Sale law. It seems that there is a concern that the new law requires estate sale companies to guarantee that the estate sale will bring in $20,000 or make up the difference. This is not true.<br>
		<br>
		The new law merely requires the estate sale company to be bonded to provide a source of recovery for the seller or the State of Minnesota should the estate sale company not follow its contractual or legal obligations.<br>
		<br>
		So relax, my friends. Get your bond and follow honest and sound business practices and you will have no worries about the new law.<br>

		AAA Auction Helps Launch a New Cable TV Show: Auction on Wheels</strong><br>

		<a name="2012-09-19"></a><strong>Online Estate Auctions vs. Traditional Estate Sales</strong><br>
		September 19, 2012<br>
		<br>
		Auctions at AAA Action and www.auctionmn.com are better than estate sales because:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Online estate auctions avoid having a person price something so high it doesn't sell or so low it sells right away for less money than it is worth.</li>
			<li>Competitive bidding means that you get top dollar on each item you sell.</li>
			<li>There is seldom anything left over after an auction.</li>
			<li>You don't have hordes of people wandering through your house.</li>
			<li>More people are exposed to your items in our online estate auctions. We have around 50,000 page hits per week on our web site alone. That makes us the highest volume online seller in Anoka County.</li>
			<li>We pay our clients very quickly (in about 7-10 days), not in six weeks like most estate sale companies.</li>
			<li>We describe each item and often include several photographs of each item as well. Most estate sale companies take only one photograph of an item and do not describe it.</li>
			<li>When required, we have certified appraisers on our staff who can provide you with well-researched opinions on the value of an item.</li>
			<li>For higher value items you can place a minimum selling price.</li>
			<li>At AAA Auction and www.auctionmn.com we appreciate your business and will treat you the way we would like to be treated if we were a seller or a buyer.</li>
		</ul>Auctionmn.com has around 50,000 page hits per week so that's a lot of people looking at our web site. This volume of traffic will ensure that your items are sold for the right price. At an estate sale, if the item is priced too high, it won't sell at all and if it's priced too low, you lose money. Our auctions usually get the right bids for the true value of the items.<br>

		<strong>Tools Tools Tools</strong><br>
		June 19, 2012<br>
		<br>
		AAA Auction was chosen to liquidate a huge inventory of new tools from a former tool salesman. These tools include everything from large welders to small hand tools. We haven't unpacked everything yet, so we don't know what all we have to sell. We do have, however, many very large tools that require a forklift or at least a dolly to move. Our first tool auction will be online only. It will start soon and end on July 9th. After that, we plan to have a live auction at the AAA Auction and Estate Center on July 15th,with online pre-bids for that auction during the week before. This is a must-see auction for the handyman and contractor.<br>

		<strong>We Buy Whole Estates</strong><br>
		May 30, 2012<br>
		<br>
		At AAA Auction we recommend the method of selling your property that puts the most money in your pocket. This could mean that we sell your items at the AAA Auction and Estate Center on commission or it might mean we come to your house and do an online estate auction or an old-fashioned auction. But if you don't have the time for either of these options, AAA Auction will also purchase your single items or your whole estate outright and move it away for you. If you call us today, your items could be gone tomorrow.<br>

		<strong>Tony Brings in $191,000 for Habitat for Humanity</strong><br>
		April 23, 2012<br>
		<br>
		Last Saturday night I had the privilege of working for Twin Cities Habitat for Humanity and the Fladaboe Benefit Auction Company. I was tremendously moved when in response to the program, a video, and my pleas, the audience pledged over $191,000 and received nothing in return except a tax deduction and the rewarding feeling of helping folks less fortunate. How lucky we are to live in a community where people care about one another.<br>

		There are No Friends at an Auction</strong><br>
		April 19, 2012<br>
		<br>
		All auctions in Minnesota are with "reserve" unless advertised as "absolute." With "reserve" means that seller has the right to buy back his own items or to bid on them if he thinks the price is too low. However, as stated in the terms of our consignment contracts, if a seller buys back his own items, he is charged not only the seller's commission, but the buyer's premium as well. Therefore we seldom see a seller buying back his own items.<br>
		On the other hand, it is illegal for two or more bidders work together to keep the price down on items they want to buy. For example, if two bidders are both interested in the same two items, it would be illegal for them to agree to have each of them bid on just one item and not the other. It may be a surprise for some to know that such an agreement is actually a felony. The Sherman Act calls this "restraint of trade" and declares such activity to be a felony. That's why you may have heard it said that: "There are no friends at an auction."<br>

		Hello Auction Friends,<br>
		<br>
		Most of you follow AAA Auction and auctionmn.com for all the great auctions we have online and we are grateful that you do that. I would like to take a moment though to let you know that I also provide fund-raising auction services. As a matter of fact, I was the first auctioneer in Minnesota to earn the designation "BAS" from the National Auctioneer's Association as a Certified Benefit Auction Specialist.<br>
		In the last several years I have helped raise millions of dollars for many diverse non-profits. I accomplish that with a high energy, fun, and sometimes emotionally powerful auction style. Please <a href="http://www.auctionmn.com/video1.shtml" target="_blank">watch my Benefit Auction video</a> if you would like to see a short sample of what I can do.<br>
		So, if your church, school, or other non-profit needs an auctioneer, please ask them to call me at (763) 421-2099 and mention your name. If your organization hires me and lets me know that you referred me, I will be happy to pay you $150 and also make a personal contribution to your organization of $100.<br>
		<br>
		Thank you.<br>
		<br>
		Tony Elfelt, BAS<br>

		<strong>Live Storage Auction on March 25th with Online Prebidding</strong><br>
		February 21, 2012<br>
		<br>
		Hello Bidders,<br>
		<br>
		We now have a firm date for the 24-vault auction at AAA Movers in Crystal. It will be on Sunday, March 25th starting at noon. We will post photos online and allow prebidding on <a href="http://www.auctionmn.com/">www.auctionmn.com</a> about 10 days prior. Prebidding will end at 9 a.m. on March 25th, the day of the live auction. Live bidding will start where the prebids leave off. We will place bids for any prebidder who also places a maximum bid online. Please note that we are not selling the wooden vaults themselves or any packing materials or shipping blankets that may be in the vaults. There will be no pre-auction preview. There will be an opportunity to look into the vaults immediately before the bidding begins on each vault. The vaults are 5' x 7' x 7'. We will remove one door from one end of each vault, but everyone will be required to stand back several feet from the vaults. Nothing can be unloaded or touched.<br>
		<br>
		Payment for the vaults must be in cash or by credit card. Winners will be allowed to have access to their purchases after the live auction is over, (which we expect to be around 1:30 p.m.) but not before. Winners must remove their purchases immediately after the live auction ends. Pickup for the online winners will be from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. after the live auction ends on Sunday, March 25th.<br>
		<br>
		Are you as excited as we are? See you there!<br>

		Legal Tidbits</strong><br>
		February 10, 2012<br>
		<br>
		Hello Bidders,<br>
		<br>
		Many of you know that I am also a lawyer. My law office is on Main Street across from the Anoka Government Center where I work with Bill Erhart in our law firm called Erhart and Elfelt, LLC. For over 30 years, my law practice has involved protecting the rights of injured people. This has mainly focused on making sure my clients' bills get paid and that they are fairly compensated for injuries caused by other people. I have handled thousands of cases ranging from neck and back pain to broken bones, paralysis and death. There is no charge to talk with me, so if you or someone you know could use some good legal advice, please call me at (763) 444-4444.<br>
		<br>
		Also, many people who come to the AAA Auction and Estate Center are there because the responsibility of handling a deceased person's estate has fallen to them. When that happens, there are often other legal concerns that go beyond selling the personal property. When that happens, I refer those people to my partner, Bill Erhart. Bill has over 33 years of experience assisting people with drawing up their wills and handling probate matters. He is thorough, smart and tough when it's required and you can also reach him at (763) 444-4444. If you mention that you saw this note, you will receive a free 1/2 hour estate planning consultation.<br>
		Bill and I will post updates regarding interesting developments in personal injury and estate planning law to our "<a href="http://www.auctionmn.com/legaltidbits.shtml">Legal Tidbits</a>" page, which you can display by clicking on the Legal Tidbits button in the menu on the left side of our home page.<br>

		<strong>Plenty More to sell!</strong><br>
		February 6, 2012<br>
		<br>
		Hello Bidders,<br>
		<br>
		Welcome to all bidders new and old who joined us last Saturday for our Live/Online Proxibid auction. For those of you who logged in and listened to the auction, I hope you had a good experience. We had bidders from 25 states and we'll be busy shipping items for a while. We also recognize that some folks had trouble using the Proxibid web site, so many of you will be happy to hear that the next auction we will be putting up from this large collectible estate will be right here on this very web site. We have plenty more to sell and there's still more for us to bring to the AAA Auction and Estate Center.<br>

		Hello Bidders,<br>

		I would like to thank all the generous people at St. John the Baptist Church and School in New Brighton who welcomed me as the live benefit auctioneer for the 2012 Wines to Wishes Gala. We had a great time and raised a great deal of money for a new P.A. system for the school. It warms the heart being among such generous people.<br>

		<strong>Second Auction of 40-plus-year Collection</strong><br>
		January 23, 2012<br>
		<br>
		Hello Bidders,<br>
		As you know, we have been honored with the opportunity to sell a very large collectible estate. The auction that closed on January 23rd is the first full auction of these unique collectibles. Our next auction for this estate, which will be posted very soon, will be on <a href="http://www.proxibid.com/">www.proxibid.com</a>.<br>
		You will still be able to review the photos and descriptions for this auction on our own web site as usual, but there will be no bidding boxes there. In order to bid, you will need to register at and log on to <a href="http://www.proxibid.com/">www.proxibid.com</a>. If you are unfamiliar with Proxibid, you can go to their web site and watch some of the auctions that are always taking place. When the auction is ready, we will post a link on our home page, and send out an e-mail to those of you who have an auctionmn.com bidder number.<br>
		Many of you will recall the <a href="http://www.proxibid.com/asp/Catalog.asp?aid=41550" target="_blank">Proxibid auction that we held last August</a> at our former location in Anoka. This new auction will be just like that one except we will, unfortunately, not have any in-person bidding at the AAA Auction and Estate Center. The auction will run for several days, and you can put in a maximum bid so the system will bid on your behalf whether or not you are logged in. The auction close will be a little different. We will be doing a "live close" instead of a "timed close." You will have the opportunity to listen to a live auction chant on you computer and to bid online in real time for each of the items as they come up for auction.<br>
		Winning bidders may pick up their items at the AAA Auction and Estate Center, or they may choose to have them shipped. Details will be in the auction listing.<br>

		<strong>New Late Pickup Terms</strong><br>
		January 10, 2012<br>
		<br>
		Hello Bidders,<br>
		<br>
		Denise and I would like to thank all of the many people bidding on auctionmn.com. As you know, our auction family is growing rapidly. While we are very appreciative of our growth, the volume of items that we have been selling has presented some challenges. One of those is late pickups which create added cost in staff time, and a delay in processing our next auction. They also unfairly delay the consignor from receiving payment for his items. Also, since our space is limited, storing the late pickups also creates a space issue. So, we would like to thank all of our bidders who pick up their items at the scheduled time and we ask everyone else to try to do the same.<br>
		<br>
		The late pickup situation has required us to implement these new procedures as of the January 18th pickup:<br>
		<ol>
			<li>Starting with our auction ending on January 16th, we will add to our regular Wednesday pickup a Thursday pickup opportunity from 9 am until noon.</li>
			<li>We will start charging $10.00 for any late pickup.</li>
			<li>For late pickups and for those bidders who registered with a credit card, there will be a $10 late fee charged to the bidder's credit card.</li>
			<li>For those bidders who did not register with a credit card, their bidding privileges will be suspended until they pay for their items along with the late fee, and add their credit card information to their bidder profile.</li>

		40-plus-year Collection</strong><br>
		January 4, 2012<br>
		<br>
		Hello Auction Friends,<br>
		<br>
		I hope everyone had a safe and happy New Year's celebration. I know we did. The fish were really biting until the wind blew us off the lake. That's was OK though because Denise and I were anxious to go home and get busy putting up the first items from the 40-plus-year collection we promised you. Some pieces will go up this weekend for our auction closing on January 16th. Our Auction and Estate Center is full now, and we are going back for more soon. If you like kitchen collectibles, Griswold items, toys from the 30's and 40's, clocks, vintage needlepoint, glassware, antiques and the like, you will want to stay tuned.<br>

		<strong>How-to-Bid Reminders</strong><br>
		October 25, 2011<br>
		<br>
		Here are some brief reminders about how to place bids.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Two "Submit Bids" Buttons</strong><br>
		After you click the "Submit Bids" button, the computer will summarize your bids for you and show a new "Submit Bids" button, which you must also click for your bids to be processed. After your bid has been successfully submitted, you will see a screen that shows whether you are now the high bidder or whether someone else has previously placed a higher maximum bid.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>"Outbid" E-mails and "Outbid" Red Triangles</strong><br>
		If you are the high bidder and you get outbid at a later time, you will receive an e-mail notifying you of that. However, if the auction is already in the process of closing, you will not receive an e-mail. If you are logged in, a red triangle will appear next to those lots on which you have been outbid. You can log in by placing another bid, or by entering your bidder number and password at the bottom of a page with bidding boxes, then clicking the "Review Bids" button. That button limits the list of lots to display only those lots that you have bid on.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Refresh Often</strong><br>
		After the auction starts to close, it is important to frequently refresh your browser to show up-to-date bids. When the auction is closing, there will be a "Refresh" link next to each lot's listing. Each of those links will refresh the entire page. You can also use your browser's refresh or reload option. If you do not refresh, your screen will show outdated information, and you may be surprised to find out later that someone else was the high bidder on your lot.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Closing Time Extensions</strong><br>
		Any bid placed within three minutes of the closing time for a lot will extend the bidding time (delay the closing time) for that lot. Due to the way our system records bids, the actual extended time will be between two and three minutes. Each new bid during the extended bidding time will further extend the bidding time, until no bids are received during the last time extension.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>"Your Maximum" Bidding Box</strong><br>
		You can save time by entering the largest amount that you are willing to pay for a lot in the box in the column labeled "Your Maximum." Our system will then bid on your behalf in set increments, bidding the minimum amount required, up to your maximum bid (which you may later raise by placing another bid). Your maximum bid must be at least equal to the amount shown in the "Next Bid Required" column.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Here are the bid increments:</strong><br>
		<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" height="456" width="350">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td align="center">Current Price is at least...</td>

		<strong>Reduced Credit Card Convenience Fees and Increased Buyer's Premium</strong><br>
		October 10, 2011<br>
		<br>
		As everyone knows, the bank charges us a fee when folks pay with a credit card and we have been charging an extra 5% buyer's premium to cover those fees. From now on though, we will charge a credit card convenience fee of only 3%. On the other hand, we have found it necessary to raise the buyer's premium to 13%. While some companies still charge a 10% buyer's premium, when we did a survey, we found that buyer's premiums of more than 10% are not uncommon with some companies charging 15% and even 16.785%. We hope that you will continue to agree that the quality of our service is well worth the fees we charge. Thank you.<br>

		<strong>We are Moving</strong><br>
		September 3, 2011<br>
		<br>
		Yes, the rumors are true. We have lost our lease and will be leaving our space in Anoka at the end of September. We are not, however, leaving the business. We are looking for another location where we will be able to continue holding regular online and live auctions as the need arises. So we will not be accepting any more consignments this month. We will continue to hold online and live estate auctions at our sellers' homes, and we will hold one or two more online auction later this month at the AAA Auction and Estate Center. That will be it then until we find a new location.<br>
		All of us at auctionmn.com and AAA Auction would like to thank all of our consigners and buyers for providing us with the opportunity to do something we love. Many of you have become our friends through this business and we will miss seeing you until we land in a new location and see you again.<br>

		<strong><br>
		Online Estate Auctions</strong><br>
		April 20, 2011<br>
		<br>
		We will consider your special needs when making a recommendation for the best way to hold your sale. For some the best approach might be a live auction. For others it might be a traditional estate sale. But for many people an online estate auction brings in the most money with the least risk and hassle.<br>
		<br>
		Here is how we do it:<br>
		<br>
		A trained appraiser or auctioneer goes to your home and meets with you. If it turns out that we recommend an online estate auction and if that is what you choose, a date will then be set up for our staff of usually two or three people to return to your home to take pictures of everything to be sold. They will also put a numbered sticker on each item and type a description of that item into our computer.<br>
		<br>
		Once all the photos are taken and descriptions written, we will turn the data over to our webmaster, who will make every photograph look fantastic, and put the auction on the Internet for the world to see. We then return to your home again for a "preview day" which is a time when people can come to the home and inspect the items to be sold. After the auction closes at a predetermined date and time, we send all winning bidders an invoice by e-mail. We will then come back to your home two days later to collect the money from the buyers and to give them their purchases. Finally, in 7-10 days after the auction we will send you your check and a computerized printout of everything that sold.<br>
		<br>
		An online estate auction is often better than a live estate sale because:
		<ul>
			<li>The seller is not subject to leaving money on the table in case the traditional estate sale host prices something too low or too high. If the item is priced too low, it will obviously sell for below market value. If it is priced too high, it obviously won't sell at all. Then on the second day of the live estate sale when most everything is marked down 50%, the item may sell, but for less than what it is worth. For example, assume an item is worth $200, but on the first day of the sale, it is priced at $300. No one will buy it. Then on the second day when prices are routinely dropped by 50%, the item will be marked down to $150. Naturally, it will then sell, but the owner will have lost the $50 between the item's $200 real value and the selling price of $150. However, if the item were sold in an online auction, the market will drive the price up to where it should be and it will likely sell at or above the $200 value.</li><br>
			
			<li>Another reason an online estate auction is often better than a traditional estate sale is because many things are often left over after a traditional estate sale. After an online auction however, almost everything gets sold and goes away. That is because the lower value items are sold in groups or lots at an online estate auction. For example, instead of selling screwdrivers out of a box for 50 cents each and having 50 of them left over, we will sell the whole box to an online bidder. We will also sell flats or boxes of items that will include some less desirable items with the more desirable items.</li><br>
			
			<li>A traditional estate sale often has 100 or more people lined up outside the seller's door waiting for the start of the estate sale. Although they are not all allowed in at once, when the first 20 or so are allowed in, there is usually a mad rush all over the house. Items can be broken and carpets can be soiled. Items can also find their way into pockets where they do not belong. An online estate auction, however, is orderly. Since people cannot buy the item in person, there is no rush. Also, since most of the buyers will rely on the photographs and descriptions they see online, throngs of people don't go through the seller's house at all.</li><br>
			
			<li>Like it or not, people like to buy online. It's easy. It's convenient and it's fun. Online bidders also don't have to get up at four a.m. to get a number to be first in line at the estate sale in order to get the best deals. Everyone has an equal chance to bid and that means more bids and money for the seller.</li><br>
			<li>Whereas some traditional estate companies take up to six weeks to pay you the proceeds of your sale, we pay you within 7-10 days.</li>
			
		</ul>So, while there is certainly a place for traditional auctions and traditional estate sales, in many cases you can get more money with less risk and less hassle when your sale is conducted as an online auction.<br>

		Zero-Commission Boats and Motors Online Auction<br>
		Canoe &amp; Kayak Live Auction</strong><br>
		February 1, 2011<br>

		Even though it seems like this winter will never end, spring will be here before you know it. So it's not too early to start thinking about buying or selling a boat or motor. And to make your selling decision easy, auctionmn.com will waive all seller-paid commissions for all boats and motors we sell during every auction during the month of April, 2011. This only applies to motor boats. AAA Auction encourage sellers of canoes and kayaks to bring them to Midwest Mountaineering to sell on April 16th. The boats and motors will be listed in the order they come in. You can also put a reserve or minimum price on your boat or motor. So, if you have a boat or motor to sell, call us today to reserve your spot: (763) 421-2099.<br>
		<br>
		And for those of you who prefer muscle-powered watercraft, AAA Auction is pleased to announce that we have again been chosen to conduct the Canoe and Kayak Consignment Auction at <a href="http://www.outdooradventureexpo.com/201104/Auction.shtml" target="_blank">Midwest Mountaineering's Spring Expo</a> on April 16th at their store in Minneapolis.

		<strong>Green Bay Packers Framed Print</strong><br>
		January 17, 2011<br>
		<br>
		Congratulations Green Bay Packers! If the Vikings can't be there, there is no team I'd rather see in the Super Bowl than Green Bay. And for all you Packer fans, we have a special auction just for you. It closes on Monday and has only one item: a signed and numbered framed Green Bay Packers print called "The Diehards" by Don Kloetzke. It shows a couple of Packers fans and their cheesehat-wearing snowman tailgating in the snowy parking lot outside Lambeau Field while they watch the game on a portable TV. Go Packers!<br>

		Two Online Auctions Coming Up: Antiques and Collectibles, and More Unclaimed Freight</strong><br>
		January 17, 2011<br>
		<br>
		Thank you to all who attended our live auction on Saturday. It was very nice to see not only many of our old friends, but also a lot of new faces as well.<br>
		Sunday was a busy day for us at the AAA Auction and Estate Center. We unloaded the next load of unclaimed freight and then Denise and I visited with a charming couple who are downsizing in Coon Rapids and who will be having us do an antique and collectible online auction at their home. They have many very nice things, so if you like antiques and collectibles, you'll want to watch for this one. So long for now.<br>

					<td>If you were wondering why there weren't many live auctions last weekend, it's because the Minnesota State Auctioneers' Convention was being held in St. Cloud and most of the state's serious and dedicated auctioneers attended.

		<strong>Auction of Unclaimed Freight and Estate Items Now Online</strong><br>
		January 3, 2011<br>
		<br>
		Happy New Year everyone! I hope you all had a safe and enjoyable holiday. For my part, we welcomed in the New Year with a karaoke party up at the AAA Auction and Estate Center. All I have to say about that is that it was a good thing the rest of the shopping center was closed when we were singing.<br>
		We have now posted the first auction with unclaimed freight together with a couple estates. We have interesting things from all sources that you don't often see at auctions.<br>
		Also, although we already have a lot of good inventory for our January 15th live auction at the AAA Auction and Estate Center, we always have room to add additional quality consignments. So if you received a Christmas gift that you can't return but won't use, how about bringing it up to the AAA Auction and Estate Center? Please call us first though at (763) 421-3044.<br>

		<strong>Unclaimed Freight Online Auction Coming Soon</strong><br>
		December 21, 2010<br>
		<br>
		Hello Everyone,<br>
		<br>
		Thank you to all who visited us at the Anoka Auction and Estate Center for the recent indoor estate sale conducted by our good friend, Maggi, from Gently Kept Estate Sales. We heard many nice comments like how nice it was not to have to go up and down stairs in someone's house and how comfortable it was to have all the elbow room the Anoka Auction and Estate Center offers.<br>
		<br>
		Thanks also to all who bid on items in our Asian auction and in our consignment auction that closed on Monday, December 20th. We are very grateful for your bids.<br>
		We are just now starting to open up all the boxes of unclaimed freight we recently received in a large semi trailer. Although we are just starting, it looks like we are going to have a large assortment of items including a whole pallet of John Deere parts. Most of this will be put on another online auction shortly.<br>
		<br>
		Do you need a great car? Our next online auction will have a 1985 Cadillac Cimarron with only 40,080 miles on it.<br>
		We also will be holding another live auction at the AAA Auction and Estate Center soon. Please join us as a buyer or a seller, or better yet, as both.<br>
		All of us at AAA Auction and Realty and auctionmn.com would like to wish everyone a happy and joyous Christmas season.<br>

		Calling All Hunters!</strong><br>
		August 23, 2010<br>
		<br>
		Hi Folks,<br>
		<br>
		Hunting season is right around the corner. There is no better time to sell that old gun that's been under your bed for the last several years. There's also no better way to sell than online with auctionmn.com, where we have a full federal firearms license. You can also protect your gun with a reserve to make sure it doesn't sell too low. Hunting gear also sells well, so think of us when you get around to cleaning out the garage. We plan to dedicate an entire auction to guns and hunting this fall. Good items to sell are of course guns, but also ammunition, decoys, bows and arrows, stands, ATV's, boats, camouflage clothing, knives and the like.<br>

		<strong>Customer E-mails</strong><br>

		<br>
		I would like to share with you two kind e-mails that we recently received. One said, " I was greatly encouraged by how the items sold. I think we made a good decision to go with your on-line auction." The other said, "You are the only auction company we use. Everyone is always so friendly and honest."<br>
		Thank you for those kind words and thank you to everyone who has used our services.<br>

		<strong>More Drawing Winners / Time Changes for Closing and for Previews</strong><br>
		August 17, 2010<br>
		<br>
		Thank you to all of you who have obtained a bidder number for auctionmn.com. Congratulations to our final three winners in our "New Number" drawing: bidders 1237, 1260, and 1310. Each will receive $25.00 in credit for their future buyer's premiums. That concludes our contest, but not all of the good deals waiting for you at www.auctionmn.com.<br>
		<br>
		Watch for another online auction starting next week. Watch also for a LIVE estate auction to take place at a Coon Rapids home on September 18th, and a residential Champlin real estate auction coming soon as well.<br>
		<br>
		In response to a number of requests, please note that we are going to change the closing time of our auctions to 7:30 p.m. starting with the auction closing on September 6th. We are also going to hold the previews at the same time as the pickup from the preceding auction. Our pickups are on Wednesdays from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m., so naturally, the previews will take place at the same time. We hope these changes will be more convenient for everyone. Finally, if you just can't make the preview, please call us and we'll see if we can help you out.<br>

		<strong>The World's Longest Yard Sale</strong><br>
		August 7, 2010<br>
		<br>
		What a fun time Denise and I are having with our friends Carl and Eileen at the World's Longest Yard Sale. We left Minnesota last Sunday and made our way to Gadsden Alabama, the southernmost tip of the sale. It wasn't scheduled to start until Thursday, but we found some friendly folks and helped them unload their truck as they were setting up their booth. We bought some good items from them.<br>
		<br>
		We were pulling an 18' trailer. Our plan was to fill up the trailer with cool stuff to sell online at auctionmn.com. Unfortunately, we ran out of money before we ran out of space. Yesterday we were looking for sales. Today we are looking for an ATM.<br>
		<br>
		It was great fun stopping and haggling with the locals, especially in Tennessee. We met many good old boys and everyone we encountered was very friendly, except the yahoo who shot a bullet through our trailer at some point. We don't know when that happened, but I'm sure they were shooting at Carl for slamming on the brakes to stop at a sale. We really did find some good stuff. Carl is the pedal car expert and I found some Hopalong Cassidy items.<br>
		<br>
		From there we traveled north for a little slice of Georgia and into Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and then Indiana. There wasn't time to go all the way to the northern end of the sale, so we left the Highway 127 yard sale corridor and are heading northwest to Galena, Illinois.<br>

		<strong>Online Auctions</strong><br>
		July 2, 2010<br>
		<br>
		Hello Everyone, As you may know, we have just started issuing our own <a target="_blank" href="https://server2.maxanet.com/cgi-bin/mnregister.cgi?auctionmn">online bidder numbers.</a> We encourage everyone to get one and be ready to bid on some great auctions we have coming up later this month. Also, if you are not on <a href="http://www.auctionmn.com/cgi-bin/mdemail.cgi?auctionmn" target="_blank">our e-mail list</a> yet, we encourage you to join that as well so you won't miss out on any bargains.<br>
		If you are a seller, now is the time to <a href="http://www.auctionmn.com/consignment_info.shtml" target="_blank">consign your items</a>. As we get up and running we are offering sellers' commissions as low as 5% or even FREE! Those rates won't last very long though, so if you have something to sell, this is a great time to bring it in. We don't take everything though. We are trying to limit our auctions to higher-quality merchandise. So we generally don't take garage sale leftovers or items that have little or no resale value. We are always happy to answer your questions about what may or may not be worth bringing in to the AAA Auction and Estate Center.<br>
		<br>
		We also conduct auctions on site at your location and we pay generous amounts for estates we purchase outright. We can arrange to come to your home to transport your items to the AAA Auction and Estate Center in Anoka as well. Thank you.<br>

		<strong>Midwest Mountaineering Spring Expo and Online Update</strong><br>
		April 27, 2010<br>
		<br>
		What a fun day we had Saturday at Midwest Mountaineering's 50th Annual Spring Expo! We had over 100 canoes and kayaks to sell and the sellers and buyers came out in spite of the rainy weather. Fortunately we had the weather forecast, so we had time to put up canopies before the rain came. Although our online auctions are going great, I still love getting up and calling out bids to a live crowd -- even when my generator quits running and I have no loudspeakers. I guess it helps to be a loud mouth to begin with. Also, for those of you who went to the AAA Auction and Estate Center by mistake on Saturday, I apologize. The announcement that we sent out a couple months ago could have been clearer.<br>
		<br>
		AAA Auction also has now completed its 8th online auction. The most recent one was a large and very nice estate in Edina. We were very happy to have been asked to team up with Gently Kept Estate Sales for this online auction. Everything stayed right there in Edina rather than coming to the AAA Auction and Estate Center in Anoka. On-site online auctions are a great alternative to a traditional estate sale or a live auction. They usually make more money for the seller and just about everything seems to get sold. They are also a lot of fun to watch on the computer as the bids often come rushing in towards the end of the auction. We set up our online auctions to be fair to everyone. If an item receives a bid within three minutes of its scheduled closing time, the bidding for that item is automatically extended for three minutes from the time of that bid. Those time extensions continue until there are no additional bids for three minutes. Last night we had one item that was extended about ten times because there was so much competition for the item.<br>
		<br>
		Of course, sometimes an old fashioned live auction is the best choice for the seller. So, one of the most important things we do is consider the seller's needs and then make a recommendation that fits our seller best.<br>
		<br>
		See you at the auction!<br>

		Update</strong><br>
		March 1, 2010<br>
		<br>
		Wow, have things ever changed since my last post! Most noticeably, we now occupy the old grocery store next to the Anoka Drug Store in the Anoka Shopping Center. We have been doing live auctions in that location since August, 2009. This has been a very convenient and comfortable way to conduct auctions. No worries about the weather and no rush to set everything up during the 12 hours before an auction.<br>
		Our benefit auction business has been expanding as well. Although times are tough, we have found that generosity still abounds. For example, we recently sold an autographed Adrian Peterson jersey for nearly $4,000! I am told that one of the things that make our benefit business unique is that we bring trained ringmen to assist in the bidding. In my opinion, this is essential to a great benefit because the ringmen not only help persuade folks to bid, but they help make the auction a show as well as a sale.<br>

		<strong>Simpson Auction</strong><br>
		October 28, 2008<br>
		<br>
		It was AUCTION TIME again last Sunday in Andover. Little did we know when we scheduled the auction in August that we would have 50-mile-an-hour wind gusts, temperatures in the low 30s and snow. Even so, well over 100 bidders attended the Bob Simpson auction and had great buys on collectible farm toys, Elvis memorabilia, tools, guns, and more. Our food vendors kept everyone warm with hot food and our tents kept everyone out of the wind most of the time. On behalf of our clients and AAA Auction, thank you very much for attending, and we'll see you at the next AUCTION!<br>

		<strong>Benefit Auctions</strong><br>
		April 28, 2008<br>
		<br>
		Benefit Auctions are an exciting and fun way to raise money for charitable organizations. From smaller groups such as chapters of Ducks Unlimited to large organizations such as the Heart Fund and major hospitals, everyone at the auction can have fun while achieving worthwhile goals. Galas and fundraisers are quite a bit different though from the typical auctions. For example, at a Benefit Auction, the auctioneer usually sells 10 to 20 items whereas at an estate or antique auction, the auctioneer will sell hundreds of items at one auction.<br>
		<br>
		But, what the benefit auctioneer lacks in quantity, he makes up for in money raised and entertainment provided. In fact, the best benefit auctioneers think of themselves as much as entertainers as they do auctioneers. Since only about 5% of the gala guests bid at live auctions, the auctioneer needs to make the auction fun and entertaining for the other 95% of the people too. The 95% who don't bid need to have fun too so they spread the word about how enjoyable the event was and also so they come back next year ready to spend money. Not only have I been able to break many records regarding the amount of money raised at live auctions, but many folks have mentioned to me how much they have enjoyed the humor, the excitement, and even the occasional song that I use at the events where I perform.<br>
		<br>
		As one of the first Certified Benefit Auction Specialists in Minnesota, I am available to counsel your group about all phases of the Benefit, or I am available to simply conduct the live auction for you. As always, I am available for unlimited phone conferences and e-mails from all of my clients.<br>
