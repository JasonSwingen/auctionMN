Thank you for your patience. We know that the auction is important for many people and we were sad to be closed for a while; however, we are now happy to be back in business, although with some changes. All of the regular AAA Auction terms shall
still apply unless changed as noted below.

<h3>Changes for Bidders</h3>

<ol>
  <li>1. There will be no preview for items expecting to sell for $300 or less. Buyers may however void a sale if we fail to photograph or describe a significant defect in the item. For higher value items previews must be scheduled by calling AAA
    Auction at (763) 421-3044.</li>
  <li>2. Individual pick-up times per person will be scheduled at 10-minute intervals. Scheduling TBD.</li>
  <li>3. No buyer should attend pick-up if they feel ill or have been exposed to a possible case of the Corona Virus within the two weeks preceding the pick-up. For those cases, the buyer should have someone else pick up his or her purchase. AAA
    Auction will try to accommodate late pick-up requests due to the virus with no late fees.</li>
  <li>4. <b>NO CASH WILL BE USED.</b></li>
  <li>5. All purchases must be paid for with a good Minnesota check or with a credit or debit card. Also, to help our customers, AAA Auction will not charge the 3% credit card fee for the time being.</li>
  <li>6. To maintain social distancing, we ask that all buyers remain in their cars upon their arrival. Our clerk will then come to your car and receive your check or swipe your credit or debit card.</li>
  <li>7. You will then be directed to drive to an area where your items will either have been placed or will be brought out to you. Please remain in your car until all of your items have been brought out.</li>
  <li>8. AAA staff will disinfect each table used for pick-ups after each buyer picks up his items.</li>
  <li>9. You will then be able to load your items.</li>
  <li>10. Please note: If your item is large or heavy you should bring another person to help you load it. AAA staff will not be able to assist you load under any conditions.</li>
  <li>11. Except for the payment process, please maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from any other person during pick-up.</li>
  <li>12. For firearm purchases and after the buyer pays for the item, our clerk will provide the buyer with the required 4473 form which the buyer shall fill out while remaining in his car. When the buyer has completed the form, he should honk his
    horn or call out to a staff member who will retrieve the form and then direct the buyer where to park. The buyer then may begin loading any other purchase he has made, or shall wait in his car for the firearm to be brought out to him.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Changes for Sellers</h3>
<ol>
  <li>1. No items shall be consigned if they may have been exposed to the Corona Virus within the two weeks preceding drop-off.</li>
  <li>2. Items dropped off at AAA Auction for sale must be unloaded by the Seller and placed in the building in an area designated by the AAA staff.</li>
  <li>3. Consigned items will not be handled by AAA for one to two weeks after they have been consigned.</li>
</ol>
