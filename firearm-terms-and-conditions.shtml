			Special Terms
			This is a live and simulcast auction. There will be audio but no video.

			As-Is and Other Limitations
			All items are sold "AS IS"; "WHERE IS,” and "FINAL"; with no warranties, express or implied of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or the like.
			Descriptions are for informational purposes only and should not be read as
			creating any representation or warranty. Illustrations, pictures, sounds, or videos
			posted on AAA Auction's website are for identification purposes only and are not
			warranties of any type. Photos are merely representative of the items and may not
			be relied upon for disclosure of all defects. Due to the complexity of modern
			photography, it is often very difficult to get an exact and consistent representation
			of color. Therefore AAA Auction strongly recommends that bidders physically
			examine items before bidding. Buyers also agree that AAA Auction shall not be
			responsible for any variation between the catalog image and the actual item. All
			measurements are approximate and AAA Auction encourages bidders to preview
			our auctions and measure items themselves. AAA Auction does not grade items or
			guarantee the authenticity of any item, including autographs. Grading and
			specific descriptions may be provided by the sellers and are assumed to be true;
			however, AAA Auction does not know whether the descriptions and grading
			provided by sellers are correct. Description and condition reports by AAA Auction
			are based upon a visual inspection only and Buyer understands that AAA Auction
			has made no examination of any internal mechanical workings or firing mechanisms of any of the items being sold. AAA does not guarantee the accuracy of any outside appraisals. AAA Auction shall not be responsible for any errors or omissions in
			the description of the merchandise unless it is a material misrepresentation of the item. Buyer assumes complete and sole responsibility for
			inspection of items prior to bidding and relies solely on his or her own inspection
			as to the condition, authenticity, and value of items. Buyers are advised to do their
			own research before bidding on any item. The Buyer waives any and all claims
			against AAA Auction and seller based upon the condition or value of any item.

			Bidding
			Bids will be taken at the auction site from in-person bidders and also from internet
			bidders through the Proxibid website. If there are any tie bids, the Auctioneer’s
			decision regarding the winning bidder is final.

			Sale Items Subject To Change
			Announcements on the day of the auction take precedence over any printed
			material. The auctioneer reserves the right to add items to or remove items from the auction at any time, even during the bidding process; to split or combine lots; to edit descriptions; to add or remove photos; to add minimum bids or reserve
			prices; to cancel, suspend, extend or reschedule an individual item or an entire auction; or to change an auction's closing time, preview time, or pick-up time.

			Reserves
			The Seller and the auction staff reserve the right to bid on and purchase items in
			the auction. It is also possible that the Seller may have established a reserve or
			minimum selling price on an item. If that is the case, the Seller has given the
			Auctioneer the right to advance the bid on behalf of the Seller to meet the Seller’s
			minimum or reserve price.

			bids, or technical or human error or difficulties that result in loss of Bidder's internet connection with AAA Auction or ProxiBid.

			Gun Terms
			NO GUNS WILL BE TRANSFERRED AT THE AUCTION SITE.
			Federal law requires that the actual transfer of the guns be made at AAA Auction's
			place of business which is 7140 Old Viking Blvd. in Nowthen, Minnesota or at another FFL location. Therefore no background checks will be called in from the auction site. However, unless buying a black powder gun or a gun manufactured before
			1898, the in-person Buyer of a gun at the auction must fill out a Form 4473 at the auction. The Buyer’s driver’s license or other government-issued photo ID shall also be required for copying at the auction.

			The in-person Buyer shall also be required to make a $50 payment towards the purchase price of the gun when he or she turns in the 4473 form at the auction. If the response from the FBI is “Denied”, then AAA Auction shall cancel the sale and keep
			the $50 payment as liquidated damages. If the result of the background check is “Proceed”, then the balance due on the gun shall be paid when the gun is transferred to the Buyer as described below. If the response from the FBI is “Delay”, then
			the gun shall be kept by AAA Auction until AAA Auction receives the final decision from the FBI; however, if three business days pass since the original “Delay” response, and if no subsequent “Denied” response has been received by AAA Auction,
			then AAA Auction shall collect the balance due on the gun and transfer the gun to the Buyer as described below.

			The transfer of the guns shall be made at AAA Auction’s place of business during the following week at the following times of at another time if arranged with the Auctioneer at the auction:

			Monday Dec. 2 9 am until 5 pm

			Wednesday Dec. 4 6 pm until 8 pm
			Thursday Dec. 5 6 pm until 8 pm

			Failure to pick up a gun during these times or failure to make other arrangements
			with the auctioneer to pick up the gun at a different time shall result in AAA
			Auction canceling the sale in which case AAA Auctions shall keep the $50 partial
			payment described above as liquidated damages.
